## 🏛️ Official Rulebook Errata

Introduction
Page 37 - RE-ROLLS
Replace paragraph with: "Sometimes the rules allow you a re-roll' of the dice. This is exactly as it sounds - pick up the dice you wish to re-roll and roll them again. The second score counts with a re-roll even if it is a worse result than the first, and a player may only re-roll a single dice once, regardless of the source of the re-roll."

Close Combat
Page 71 - RESULTS
Replace first paragraphs with: "For each separate combat you must determine which side has won. Do this once all the units engaged in the combat have fought. Obviously if one side is completely wiped out, the other side has won with no need for a Break test."

Replace second paragraphs with: "Begin by adding up all the wounds caused by each side in the combat. It doesn't matter which particular units suffered the wounds, just add them all up. Don't forget to add the wounds taken by big creatures that haven't been removed as casualties. Do NOT count wounds saved by Armour or Ward saves."

Psychology
Page 81 - PANIC
Replace second paragraph of first column - "6) Unit wiped out by shooting...", with: "6) Unit wiped out by shooting or magic within 4" If a unit is wiped out by missile fire or magic, any friendly units within 4" of it must take a Panic test at the end of the phase, unless the destroyed unit is a single model with less than 5 Wounds on its original profile."

Page 81 - PANICKING UNITS
Replace first two paragraphs with: "A unit that fails a Panic test will flee in the same way as described for units which break in close combat or which flee from a charge. Fleeing troops abandon their formation and are moved in a rough mass 2D6" or 3D6" away from the enemy and/or source of panic, but the player is allowed to decide exactly where to flee within these guidelines. See the Close Combat section for rules governing fleeing troops."

Page 81 - IF CHARGED BY A FEAR-CAUSING ENEMY
Replace 3rd paragraph with: "If the unit fails its test but its Unit Strength is equal to or higher than the charging enemy's, it will fight on as normal but must roll 6s to score hits in the first turn of close combat."

Weapons (and Equipment)
Page 91 - HAND WEAPON
Replace 1st paragraph with: "Unless specifically noted otherwise, all models are assumed to be carrying a hand weapon of some kind. The term 'hand weapon' is used to describe any weapon held in one hand and not otherwise covered by the rules. As such it includes swords. axes clubs, maces, etc."

Characters
Page 95 - INDEPENDENT CHARACTERS JOINING UNITS
Replace 1st paragraph with: "Independent characters can move and fight on their own. In effect, a character counts as an individual unit comprising of only one model. However, during the course of a battle, a character is allowed to join a friendly unit of ordinary troops, in which case he becomes part of that unit until he decides to leave it."

Page 97 - PROXIMITY TO FRIENDLY TROOPS
Replace second paragraph with: "A character model within 5" of a friendly unit of five or more models can only be picked out as a target if he is the closest legal target. This restriction enables characters to move around behind the battlelines without attracting an unrealistic and unreasonable."

Generals & Battle Standards
Page 102 - THE BATTLE STANDARD
Replace second paragraph with: "The Battle Standard Bearer cannot be the army's General (unless specified in the character's army list entry), even if he has the highest Leadership in the army. Unlike ordinary standards the Battle Standard cannot be passed on if its bearer is slain. Should the I bearer be slain then the Battle Standard can be captured in the same way as a unit banner."

Page 102 - RE-ROLL BREAK TESTS
Replace third paragraph with: "A Battle Standard only allows a unit to retake a failed Break test. It doesn't entitle a unit to retake any other Ld test, such as a Psychology test or a test to rally. This rule ceases to apply if the Battle Standard is fleeing."

Standards, Musicians & Champions
Page 109 - CHAMPIONS
Replace second paragraph with: "Although they can be powerful in combat, Champions are not characters but members of their regiment and always fight as part of it, moving, attacking, fleeing and pursuing alongside the unit as a whole. If the unit has any special rules which apply to it, such as being stubborn or subject to frenzy, then these also apply to the Champion. Unlike characters, a Champion is not permitted to move and fight on his own, and can never leave his unit or join another one. They are effectively another model in the unit, the only difference being that they are blessed with enhanced characteristics."

Skirmishers
Page 116 - CLOSE COMBAT
Update all diagrams on this page. Replace 4th paragraph with: "If the skirmishers are charged, the enemy is brought into base contact with the closest skirmisher and then the enemy unit is halted. The enemy is not aligned against the skirmishing model. The skirmishers form up as explained above and the enemy will proceed with further charges. Charging enemy models attack first in the ensuing Close Combat phase as normal."

Page 116 - CHARACTERS
Replace paragraph with: "A roughly man-sized character on foot can join a skirmishing unit. No other characters (mounted riding in chariots, etc) can join skirmishing units."

Fast Cavalry
Page 117 - FORMATION & MOVEMENT
Replace FREE REFORM paragraph with: "Unless it charges, the fast cavalry unit can reform as many times as you wish during its Movement phase without incurring any penalties to its Move distance. See the rules for reforming (p.49). Note that no model in the fast cavalry unit can move more than its maximum Move distance despite the free reform."

Page 117 - SHOOTING AND MOVING
Replace entire paragraph with: "Fast cavalry armed with missile weapons are expert at shooting from horseback (or wolfback) and can therefore shoot even when marching or reforming. The normal -1 penalty for moving applies."

Page 117 - CHARACTERS AND FAST CAVALRY
Replace paragraph with: "Character models may join fast cavalry units and move with the unit, but do not benefit from any of the special shooting rules."

War Machines
Page 118 - SHOOTING AT WAR MACHINES
Replace second paragraph with: "When shooting at a war machine, it is treated exactly as any normal unit with regards to modifiers to hit. A war machine and its crew don't count as skirmishing, and so don't benefit from the -1 To Hit penalty. Some war machines may be classed as large targets (this will be noted in the war machine's specific rules)."

Page 119 - ATTACKING A MACHINE
Replace first paragraph with: "A war machine cannot be attacked in close combat while it still has crew. A war machine that has had its crew wiped out or broken in close combat is assumed to be spiked or otherwise disabled by the attackers, on the condition that they don't pursue or overrun."

Replace second paragraph with: "If a war machine is already abandoned when charged. it is destroyed, but no combat results are worked out, no Panic tests required, no overrun can be made, etc."

Page 122 - CANNONS
In the 1st column, replace second paragraph with: "Cannons are fired in the Shooting phase. To fire a cannon, it must first be turned on the spot so it points in the direction of the target which must be within line of sight but otherwise is not limited by targeting restrictions. Then the player must declare how far the cannon is going to shoot - eg, 24", 30", 32", etc."

Page 122 - GRAPESHOT
Replace paragraph with: "Instead of firing a normal shot, cannon crew can opt to fire grapeshot instead. Normal targeting rules apply. Grapeshot has a range of 8". If in range, the I target suffers a number of hits equal to the roll of an Artillery dice, resolved at Strength 4, with a -2 Armour save modifier. Misfires occur as described below."

Magic
Page 135 - CASTING SPELLS
Replace both paragraphs with: "In a player's Magic phase, which follows the Movement phase, each of his Wizards can attempt to cast each of his spells only once. Spell casting is determined by rolling dice, and the number of dice available to roll limits the number of spells that can be attempted. Fleeing or dead Wizards, or those with any type of armour (except a barded steed), cannot attempt to cast spells. Wizards cannot cast spells at units in close combat, unless the spell only affects themselves or otherwise says so in its description."

Page 138 - MISCAST TABLE
Replace result 2 with: "The collected magical power explodes in a ball of energy. Models in base contact, friend or foe, or the character's mount, if on a monster or chariot, suffer one Strength 10 hit, as does the casting Wizard."

Spell Lists
Page 144 - WALL OF FIRE
Replace 1st paragraph with: "This spell has a range of 24" and can be cast on an enemy unit visible to the caster which has no models (friend or foe) within 1" of its front rank (walls. hedges and other scenic features don't matter). The spell cannot be cast on units with a 360° line of sight."

Replace second paragraph with: "A searing wall of flame suddenly rises in front of the unit. To represent this take some cotton wool or paper and place this in a line up to 1" thick in front of the unit."

Replace 3rd paragraph with: "The unit suffers 1 automatic hit for each model (including characters) in its front rank. Each hit is resolved with a Strength of 4."

Page 145 - BANE OF FORGED STEEL
Replace paragraph with: "This spell has a range of 12" and can be cast on an enemy unit which is visible to the caster. If successfully cast, the enemy's weapons begin to crumble and rust away. No weapon bonuses or penalties apply to the affected unit for the remainder of the battle. For example, a unit wielding Great Swords will not get their +2 Strength bonus in combat for the rest of the battle, but will now not have to strike last. A unit with missile weapons may not shoot for the duration of the entire battle. Affected units are assumed to use their fist/claws, etc, and so cannot benefit from the rules for using two hand weapons or a hand weapon and shield. War machines and magic weapons cannot be affected by the Bane of Forged Steel - only ordinary weaponry carried by troops."

Page 146 - STEED OF SHADOWS
Replace first paragraph with: "This spell may be cast upon the Wizard himself or any single friendly independent character model within 12" of him - the spell can only be cast on a model with a Unit Strength of 1 (it won't work on a mounted model or a model riding in a chariot, for example)."

Magic Items (and Abilities)
Page 154 - DISPEL SCROLL
Replace paragraph with:

"A Dispel Scroll is inscribed with a powerful anti-magical invocation. When it is read out by a Wizard, the effect is to drain away magical power and weaken a spell that has been cast. As soon as a spell has been cast, any Wizard who has a Dispel Scroll can read it. This automatically dispels the cast spell, no dice roll is required.

Reading a Dispel Scroll will bring any spell cast by the Wizard reading it to an end. To put it another way, a Wizard who has a spell in play will automatically cancel it by reading a Dispel Scroll.

As with all scrolls, Dispel Scrolls are not unique items - they are prepared by a Wizard prior to battle and it is quite possible for several Wizards to carry Dispel Scrolls, and for a Wizard to carry more than one. However, only one can be used at a time.

Note that a Dispel Scroll will not help if the spell has been cast with Irresistible Force. Any spell that is successfully cast with two or more 6s is Irresistible and no Dispel roll is permitted."

Scenarios
Page 197 - SCENARIO CHART
Change "Flanking Force" to "Flank Attack".

Page 208 - CAPTURE - DEPLOYMENT
In the 2nd column, replace 5th paragraph with: "Victory conditions: The army with the unit closest to the objective at the end of the battle wins. Fleeing units, monsters and characters can't capture the objective. If both players have a unit equidistant from the objective, one player wins if their unit is worth more than double the points value of the closest enemy unit to the objective. Otherwise it is a draw."

Appendix
Page 239 - SELECTING TROOPS
In the last column of the last row, replace "+0" with "+0-1".

Page 239 - SELECTING CHARACTERS
Replace paragraph under chart with: "So, in this case, a 1,500 point army could include a maximum of three characters, of which up to all three could be Heroes and none can be a Lord. In a 3,500 points army there can be a maximum of six characters with up to two Lords. The army doesn't have to include the maximum number of characters and doesn't have to include Lords at all."

Page 253 - DAMAGE CHARTS
Replace '2D6 Effect' at the top of the charts with 'Damage/Effect'.

Page 262 - ACCIDENTAL CHARGES
The appendix for accidental charges on page 262 of the Warhammer rulebook has led to some dubious tactics and confusion, and should therefore be ignored.

Page 268 - SKIRMISHERS CHARGING OTHER SKIRMISHERS
Replace fig. 2b, fig. & fig. 5 with the new figures.

Page 269 - FAST CAVALRY
Replace 3rd paragraph with: "3) If a unit of fast cavalry rallies the turn after it voluntarily flees, it will be able to move normally during the Movement phase of that same turn."

Page 273 - 5. CLOSE COMBAT
Replace 'Roll to hit' entry with: "Check on the To Hit table on the next page to find the score needed on a D6 to hit. When attacking cavalry, use the rider's WS. For ridden monsters, both rider and mount use their own WS. A roll of a 1 always misses and a 6 always hits regardless of the relative Weapon Skills."
