## 🏛️ Official Faction Errata

### Dark Elves

Page 7 - BLACK GUARD - Special Rules - Hatred
Replace paragraph with: "Eternal Hatred: Black Guard are vicious killers and hate everybody and everything. In addition, hatred continues to have an effect in second and subsequent rounds of a combat."

Page 8 & 30 - COLD ONE KNIGHTS - Profiles
Replace first two profiles. Replace Ld value of 8 with 9 on both Knight and Dread Knight profiles.

Page 10 - WITCH ELVES - Special Rules - Frenzy
Replace paragraph with: "Frenzy: Witch Elves (including Hags) are affected by the rules for frenzy. While frenzied, Witch Elves still hate High Elves, although normally immune to psychology."

Page 10 - CAULDRON OF BLOOD - The Cauldron in the Game
Replace entire entry with:

"The Cauldron and its Guardians are considered to be a single entity and have a Unit Strength of 3. The Cauldron cannot move and its Guardians must remain within 2" of it. The Cauldron itself cannot be harmed. Any shooting hits scored against the unit are randomised between the Guardians and Cauldron in the same manner as war machines (discounting any hits against the Cauldron itself). The energies of Khaine surround the Cauldron, giving the guardians a 4+ Ward save against missile fire (including magic missiles), and Magic Resistance (1).

In hand-to-hand combat the guardians are assembled in front of the Cauldron in the same way as a war engine crew, fighting with any enemies in base contact. The Cauldron cannot be attacked. The Guardians cannot be broken in combat.

If all of the Guardians are killed, the Cauldron is considered destroyed.

Terror: The Cauldron of Blood is surrounded by an aura of bloodshed, and causes terror.

Red Fury: Any Dark Elf units (including the Guardians) within 24" of the Cauldron of Blood are driven into a fury of destruction by the Cauldron's presence. Affected units may re-roll failed rolls to wound in the first round of any combat. In addition, affected Witch Elf units are always frenzied - if within 24" they cannot lose their frenzy, if they have lost their frenzy and move within 24" they regain it immediately. The baleful energies seeping from the Cauldron give all Witch Elves within 24" of it a 6+ Ward save."

Page 11 - ASSASSINS - Hidden
Replace first paragraph with: "Hidden: If you wish, any Assassin in your army may start the game hidden in one of the following units: Witch Elves, Warriors, Corsairs, Executioners or Black Guard. Alternatively, he may deploy as a Scout."

Page 13 & 31 - WAR HYDRA - Profiles
Replace profiles. Replace Apprentice M value of 5 with 6.

Page 17 - WORD OF PAIN
Replace paragraph with: "Upon uttering the true name of Khaine as the Serpent Lord, an unnatural and unbearable agony suffuses the body of his hated foes. This spell can be cast on an enemy unit which is within 24 and is visible to the caster, including units in combat. Any models in the unit have their Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill reduced to 1. Once it is cast the Word of Pain remains in play until the wizard chooses to end it (which she can do at any time), it is dispelled, she attempts to cast another spell, or she is slain."

Page 18 - WEB OF SHADOWS
Replace second paragraph with: "A Web of Shadows can only be used once per game against a single enemy model. The character uses the Web of Shadows instead of making any normal attacks that round. When used, one model in base contact with the character automatically takes 2D6 Strength 3 hits. A character with a Web of Shadows may also use another ordinary close combat weapon (but not another magic weapon)."

Page 19 - BLOOD ARMOUR
Replace second paragraph with: "Blood Armour is treated as a suit of normal heavy armour (5+ save) and can be combined with other armour as normal. For every unsaved wound the wearer inflicts, their save is improved by 1 point (to 4+ then 3+, etc) up to a maximum total save of 1+."

### Dwarfs

Page 9 - ANVIL OF DOOM - The Anvil in the Game
Replace 4th paragraph with: "When shooting at the Anvil of Doom, randomise hits evenly between the Dwarfs and the Anvil (discounting any hits against the Anvil itself). To take into account the protection offered by the Anvil, the Runelord gains a 4+ Ward save against any form of missile (including magic missiles)."

Page 19 - RULE OF THE RUNES - #2
Replace rule 2 with: "2. Weapon runes can only be inscribed on weapons, Armour runes can only be inscribed on armour, Runic Standards can only be inscribed on standards, Engineering runes can only be inscribed on war machines, and Talismanic runes can only be inscribed on talismans (of which more later). This is called the Rule of Form by Runesmiths. You cannot inscribe Armour runes on cannon nor can you place Engineering runes on an axe."

Replace second sentence of rule 3 with: "You could not have a rune-hammer and a rune-axe both engraved with a Rune of Speed and a Rune of Fire, for example."

The character also has the Killing Blow special rule."

Page 30 - REPEATER BOLT THROWER
Replace paragraph below characteristics profile with: "* Note that 1-2 Repeater Bolt Throwers count as only one Rare unit choice.

Special Rules: Repeater Bolt Thrower."

Page 73 - WAR CROWN OF SAPHERY
Replace second paragraph with: "Any spell which is normally limited to a specific range in inches is now of unlimited range. Spells that only affect the caster, all units within a certain range of the caster or may already be cast anywhere are not altered. Note that this does not mean that he can cast spells at targets that are out of sight if the spell normally requires line of sight."

### Hordes of Chaos

Page 40 - FLAMERS OF TZEENTCH
Replace second paragraph of 'Special Rules' with: "Accompany Horrors: Flamers must be deployed at the same time and within 5" of the unit of Horrors they have been bought with. After that they are free to move as they like, and each counts as a separate unit for the rest of the game (including for the purpose of calculating Victory points). If a Flamer is more than 5" away from a unit of Horrors at the end of any Chaos turn, it must immediately take a Leadership test. If the test is failed, the daemon is destroyed."

Page 52 - STAFF OF CHANGE
Replace rules paragraph with: "The bearer can make a Single re-roll of one or more dice rolled to cast or dispel a spell. The second result(s) stand. This can negate the effects of a Miscast and cause an Irresistible Force (and the equivalent results when dispelling). If the bearer casts a spell with Irresistible Force using the staff's re-roll ability, the staff will exhaust its power and cease working for the rest of the battle."

### Lizardmen

Page 31 - STEGADONS - Special Rules - Giant Bow

The giant bow can move and fire, although it can only fire in the arc of sight of the Stegadon itself. It takes two crew to fire the giant bow (so two Skinks can't throw javelins if they are crewing the giant bow). As the Stegadon is a large target, the giant bow may shoot over normal sized units and interposing terrain that large targets can see over."

### Ogre Kingdoms

Page 64 - SKULLMANTLE
Replace the final two words of text "....their Leadership" with "....the Leadership test".

Page 69 - ARMY BATTLE STANDARD

All war machines and other ranged attacks that do not use BS may only fire if the player first rolls a 4+ on a D6 (roll for each model). Magic missiles and other ranged spells are not affected. Roll a D6 at the beginning of each player's subsequent turns - on a roll of 1 or 2, the power of the banner is exhausted and it no longer has any effect for the remainder of the battle."
