# Warhammer: Fantasy Battles - 6th Definitive Edition

This project intends to collect all the rules published for the 6th edition of Warhammer: Fantasy Battles. This include everything published in rulebooks, supplements, magazines and the GW old website.
It also tries to add the references to all the rules written here, so any player can both check their legitimacy and consult the original material instead.

Ideally we will also apply F.A.Q.s, erratas and any other patch, update or change in the rules during the 6th edition.

The data is heavily based on [Ergofarg's work](https://github.com/Ergofarg/Warhammer-Fantasy-6th-edition/), which was the first stone. Everything else has been built over his work.

The main additions are:
  - Options for the alternative lists!
  - Special characters!
  - More references to the rules!
  - All the experimental rules of the 6th edition!
