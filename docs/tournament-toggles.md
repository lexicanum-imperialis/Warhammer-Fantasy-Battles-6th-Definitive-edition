# Configuring the Engine for Tournaments [WIP]

The Definitive Engine is built to support your local meta. When creating a new list or tournament in NewRecruit, TOs and players can use the following configuration toggles:

* **[Toggle] Standard Rules Only:** Disables all White Dwarf and Appendix lists. Limits characters to core Army Books.
* **[Toggle] Enable Special Characters:** Unlocks the 170+ special characters verified by the engine.
* **[Toggle] Enable Experimental / Appendix Lists:** Allows players to select lists like the *Zombie Pirates of the Vampire Coast* or *Cult of Slaanesh*.
* **[Toggle] Enable Regiments of Renown:** Allows Dogs of War mercenaries to be taken as Special/Rare choices as per their specific army rules.

All math, points limits, and percentage caps will automatically adjust based on the toggles selected.
