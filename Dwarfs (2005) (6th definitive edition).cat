      <description>Kraggi is treated as a unit Champion and fights with his forge tongs (counts as a hand weapon) and wears a thick leather apron to protect him from the intense heat (light armour).

While Kraggi is alive Thorek may re-roll a failed attempt to strike a rune on the Anvil of Doom. If this extra dice rolls a 1, Kraggi has done something wrong and you should subtract 1 from the roll on the Anvil Miscast table (Failed Rune Table), treating a total of 0 as 1.</description>

      <description>The Runelord and the two Anvil Guards must remain for all the battle on the platform. They are Unbreakable, may not declare charges and will never pursue beaten foes. The Anvil and crew have a Unit Strength of 5. No other characters may join the Anvil crew.

Enemy units that charge the Anvil model are placed in base contact with the platform. The Runelord and the Guards place themselves between the enemy and the Anvil, without leaving the Anvil&apos;s platform. The Anvil and crew count as a unit with a 60mm wide frontage for the purposes of close combat.

When shooting at the Anvil of Doom, randomise hits evenly between the remaining Dwarfs. To take into account the protection offered by the Anvil, the Runelord and Anvil Guards gain a 4+ Ward Save against any form of missile (this includes magic missiles as well as normal missiles).

**Equipment**
The Anvil Guard wear gromril armour and each carries a hand weapon and shield.

**Victory Points**
Score Victory Points for the Runelord as normal.

If the Runelord and both guards are killed then Victory Points are scored for the Runelord as normal and the Anvil in addition.

**Dispel Dice**
While the owning Runelord lives, an Anvil adds an extra dice to the Dwarfs&apos; Dispel pool.</description>

    <rule name="Flame Cannon" id="7e17-a456-8fae-2780" hidden="false" publicationId="45c1-a503-0feb-507a" page="39">
      <description>|Movement|Toughness|Wounds|
|---|---|---|
|As crew|7|3|

The Flame Cannon can be moved at the speed of its crew as specified for Cannons in the Warhammer rulebook. The Flame Cannon may be turned on the spot to face its target, but cannot otherwise move and fire in the same turn.

**Loss of Crew**
The Flame Cannon is affected by loss of crew as detailed in the main Warhammer rules.

**Firing the Flame Cannon**
Flame Cannons shoot in a similar way to cannons, but instead of firing a cannon ball they shoot a gout of flame - use the Flame template to represent this.

|Range|Strength|Wounds|Armour Save|
|---|---|---|---|
|12&quot;|5|D3|-2|

To fire the cannon, first turn it on the spot so that it points at your intended target. Now declare how far you wish to shoot, up to a maximum of 12&quot;, eg, 12&quot;, 10&quot;, 7&quot;, etc. This represents the gunners elevating the barrel to get the required trajectory. The jet of inflammable liquid will travel the distance you have nominated plus the score of an Artillery dice (marked 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and Misfire).

Roll the Artillery dice and add the score to the distance you have nominated. The jet travels the total distance and will land short, hit the target, or pass over it depending on how accurately you have guessed the range and what effect the dice roll has.

When you have established where the jet of flaming liquid hits the ground, place the Flame template on that spot. The jet sprays out from this point and scorches a line through any targets in its way. To determine the swathe cut by the burning liquid, place the Flame template with the narrow end on the point where the jet hit the ground and the wide end pointing directly away from the cannon so that the flame continues in a straight line. Any models completely under the template are automatically hit and models partially covered are hit on the roll of a 4+. Any model struck by the flame takes a Strength 5 hit and any model wounded by the flame takes D3 wounds. Saving throws apply as normal (ie, -2 Armour Save).

A unit that suffers casualties from the Flame Cannon, must take an immediate Panic test to represent the horrific effects of this weapon.

If you roll a Misfire on the Artillery dice then the Flame Cannon has malfunctioned. Roll a D6 and check the Flame Cannon Misfire chart below to see what happens.

|D6|Result|
|1|**Destroyed!** Smoke begins to pour from the barrel in a worrying fashion and a few seconds later it explodes into a fireball, engulfing everyone nearby. The Flame Cannon is destroyed and its crew slain.|
|2-3|**Malfunction**: The mixture fails to ignite and the cannon squirts smelly hot oil and tar into the air. Although unpleasant, this is not deadly, and has no effect on the target. The crew must prepare the cannon for firing again, so the Flame Cannon may not shoot this turn or next turn.|
|4-6|**Phut**: The pressure is not high enough, so the Flame Cannon may not fire this turn.|</description>

    <rule name="Firing the Dwarf Organ Gun" id="ad3e-055f-9927-3519" hidden="false" publicationId="45c1-a503-0feb-507a" page="40">
      <description>In the Shooting phase, nominate a target unit and turn the Organ Gun so that it faces it. Roll the Artillery dice and then measure the range. If the target unit is within range it will suffer a number of hits equal to the number rolled on the Artillery dice. Hits are resolved using the profile below.

If you roll a Misfire, the cannon has misfired and may explode. Roll a D6 and consult the Organ Gun Misfire chart below to see what happens.

Whenever you fire the Organ Gun you may re-roll the Artillery dice if it didn&apos;t score a Misfire. If a Misfire results on the re-roll it automatically causes a *Fzzz. Clunk* result as the gun simply fails to fire.

|D6|Result|
|1-2|**Destroyed!** The gun explodes with a mighty crack. Shards of metal fly in all directions leaving a hole in the ground, a cloud of black smoke and the stench of burnt beards. The gun is destroyed and its crew slain or injured. Remove the Organ Gun and its crew.|
|3-4|**Malfunction**: The gun fails to ignite and does not fire. The crew fuss around, banging it with hammers and muttering to themselves before working out what is wrong. The gun cannot fire this turn or next turn.|
|5-6|**Fzzz... Clunk**: A minor fault prevents the gun firing. Perhaps the fuse is not set properly or maybe the young crew mishandled the loading procedure. The Organ Gun does not shoot this turn. However, it is unharmed and may shoot as normal next turn.|</description>

Miners do not have to be deployed on the table at the beginning of the battle.

Instead, starting from turn two, at the beginning of every Dwarf turn roll a dice: on a 4+ the Miners will arrive. For every successive turn after the second, add a further +1 to the roll, so they arrive on a 3+ in turn three, and so on (but an unmodified roll of 1 is always a failure).

In the Movement phase of the turn when they arrive, Miners can enter the battlefield from any table edge and will be treated exactly like a unit that has pursued an enemy off the table in the previous turn. If the Miners fail to turn up for the entire game, they have obviously got lost in the tunnels, but their points are not awarded to the opponent.</description>

      <description>The Organ Gun has more barrels than an ordinary cannon but these are smaller and lighter. Its range and the damage it inflicts are considerably different from a cannon&apos;s.

|Movement|Toughness|Wounds|
|---|---|---|
|As crew|7|3|

|Range|Strength|Armour|Save|
|---|---|---|---|
|24&quot;|5|-3|

Organ Guns are stoutly made from iron and can sustain considerable damage as shown on their profile. The Organ Gun can be moved at the speed of its crew as specified for Cannons in the Warhammer rulebook. The Organ Gun cannot move and shoot in the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face its target.

**Loss of Crew**
The Organ Gun is affected by loss of crew as detailed in the main Warhammer rules.

**Firing the Dwarf Organ Gun**
In the Shooting phase, nominate a target unit and turn the Organ Gun so that it faces it. Roll the Artillery dice and then measure the range. If the target unit is within range it will suffer a number of hits equal to the number rolled on the Artillery dice. Hits are resolved using the profile below.

If you roll a Misfire, the cannon has misfired and may explode. Roll a D6 and consult the Organ Gun Misfire chart below to see what happens.

Whenever you fire the Organ Gun you may re-roll the Artillery dice if it didn&apos;t score a Misfire. If a Misfire results on the re-roll it automatically causes a Fzzz. Clunk result as the gun simply fails to fire.

|D6|Result|
|1-2|**Destroyed!** The gun explodes with a mighty crack. Shards of metal fly in all directions leaving a hole in the ground, a cloud of black smoke and the stench of burnt beards. The gun is destroyed and its crew slain or injured. Remove the Organ Gun and its crew.|
|3-4|**Malfunction**: The gun fails to ignite and does not fire. The crew fuss around, banging it with hammers and muttering to themselves before working out what is wrong. The gun cannot fire this turn or next turn.|
|5-6|**Fzzz... Clunk**: A minor fault prevents the gun firing. Perhaps the fuse is not set properly or maybe the young crew mishandled the loading procedure. The Organ Gun does not shoot this turn. However, it is unharmed and may shoot as normal next turn.|</description>

      <description>During his own Shooting phase the Runelord may strike a single rune each turn. A rune may not be struck if the Runesmith or Guards are in close combat. Anvils are ancient beyond reckoning and have powers that few Runesmiths dare to call upon. When striking a rune, a Runesmith must choose whether he will strike it normally or try to call forth its ancient power.

A rune is struck correctly on a D6 roll of 2+ if struck normally, 4+ if struck with ancient power. If the rune is not struck correctly, roll a D6 and consult the Failed Rune table to determine the effect on the Anvil.

**1. Rune of Hearth &amp; Hold**
The Rune of Hearth and Hold was originally the gift of Valaya to the Dwarfs. With each blow of the hammer a low bass note resonates across the battlefield, reminding all friendly Dwarf units of hold, clan and ancestors. Every friendly Dwarf unit may re-roll failed Fear or Terror tests while the note lasts. Remember you may never re-roll a re-roll.

The note lasts until the start of the owning player&apos;s next Shooting phase.

**Ancient Power**. If the Runelord attempts to use the full power of the runes then all friendly Dwarf units may re-roll failed Panic and Break tests, and are immune to fear and terror while the note lasts.

**2. Rune of Oath &amp; Honour**
When the runes are struck, Grungni&apos;s blessing is placed upon the works of the Dwarfs. The Dwarfs, whose resolution and endurance is legend anyway, are driven to make an extra supernatural effort to ensure that they do their duty. A single, friendly Dwarf unit (but not a Gyrocopter) may make a normal move (which can be a March or Charge) in the Shooting phase.

Units that move in this way may not shoot in the Shooting phase. Units which rallied earlier in the turn may not make this move.

**Ancient Power**. If the Runelord uses the full power of the runes then D3 friendly Dwarf units will be affected.

**3. Rune of Wrath &amp; Ruin**
When the Anvil is struck and the name of Grimnir is invoked, the power of the Rune of Wrath &amp; Ruin causes the sky to darken and the earth to crack, venting fire and sulphur. Nominate an unengaged enemy unit anywhere on the table. You may not target independent characters unless they (or their mounts) are large targets. The target unit takes D6 magical Strength 4 hits distributed in the same way as Shooting hits. If that unit has the Fly ability then it cannot Fly in its next Movement phase. If it is not a Flyer then its Movement characteristic is halved until the end of its own following turn. If forced to flee, for whatever reason, the unit flees at half speed (determine the flee distance of the unit as normal and then halve the score, rounding up).

**Ancient Power***. If the Runelord attempts to use the full power of the runes then D3 enemy units are affected and each takes 2D6 magical Strength 4 hits.</description>

      <description>A Dwarf General may be carried into battle atop a shield carried by two loyal (and strong) retainers.

A General and his Shieldbearers fight as a single model with a Unit Strength of 3 (even in challenges). They are mounted on a 40mm wide by 20mm deep base. The Shieldbearers add 2 to the Armour Save of the character (to a maximum of 1+) mounted on the shield. The Shieldbearers give the General two extra WS5 Strength 4 Initiative 3 close combat attacks each round but these attacks do not benefit from any weapon (runic or otherwise) carried by the General.

If a General with Shieldbearers fights with a unit, he counts as two normal models for the purposes of working out if there is a complete rank of four models. Note that when in a unit, a Lord and his Shieldbearers may still use the &quot;Look Out, Sir!&quot; rule and are not considered a larger target than the other unit members.</description>

      <description>All Slayers have an uncanny ability that makes them particularly effective against especially tough opponents. When rolling to wound, a Slayer&apos;s Strength, including any modifiers for weapons (eg, a great axe), is increased until it is equal to the Toughness of his opponent, up to a maximum of Strength 6. If the opponent&apos;s Toughness is lower than the Slayer&apos;s Strength, including any additional modifiers for weapons, the Slayer does not receive any Strength bonus. For example, a Slayer armed with a great axe (S5) is fighting a Dragon (T6): normally he needs a 5+ to wound, but because of the Slayer skill his Strength is increased to 6 and he therefore wounds on a 4+. Note that the Armour Save modifier is calculated at the modified Strength score, in this case it is -3 for a Strength 6 hit. If the Slayer were fighting a weedy Goblin (13), he would use his normal Strength of 5 and would therefore wound the Goblin on a 2+, with an Armour Save modifier of -2.</description>

At the start of any combat, a Slayer unit may choose to fight either with two axes counting as having an additional hand weapon, or to take a single axe in both hands, counting it as a great weapon. If the Slayer has a rune axe then this rule ceases to apply and he fights with the rune axe only, generally as a hand weapon but possibly as a great weapon if it has the Master Rune of Kragg the Grim inscribed on it.


Once they have made the choice on how to use their axes they must continue doing this until the combat is over.</description>

      <description>At the start of the game, a character with an Oath stone must nominate a unit of Warriors (but NOT Rangers), Longbeards, Ironbreakers or Hammerers to be his Stonebearers. The character must deploy with this unit and cannot leave it during the game. The presence of the stone with the unit confers Magic Resistance (1) as its runes act to absorb wild magic. No other character may join a Stonebearer unit.
Furthermore, while the character lives, if the Stonebearer unit is charged, the character may &apos;set the stone&apos; and stand upon it as part of a Hold reaction. This indicates that he has chosen to stand and fight where he is. Accordingly his Stonebearers, inspired by his resolve, form up around him, facing in all directions. It is not necessary to move the models to represent this. Setting the stone has the following effects:
- The Stonebearer unit has no flanks or rear from this point, even if the character on the stone is killed. This means, for example, that they do not lose their rank bonuses if charged in flank or rear, that no enemy unit gets a combat resolution bonus for attacking them in flank or rear and so on.
- The Stonebearer unit may not move in any way unless forced to Flee and may not choose to Flee as a charge reaction. The character on the stone may not be moved within the unit.
- A Character on an Oath stone must always issue a challenge in close combat and meet any challenge whether he is fighting or not (he is not hard to find - he&apos;s the one on the stone!).
- If the Stonebearer unit flees, then the Oath stone is lost. Also the Victory Points for the owning character are lost whether he survives the battle or not, such is his dishonour.</description>

              <description>&gt; **Q If an attack is obviously based on fire (such as a Dwarf Flame Cannon&apos;s shot), but it was published before the term &apos;Flaming Attack&apos; was formalised in seventh edition, does it count as a Flaming Attack or not?**
&gt; _A. We cannot answer this question with an all-encompassing rule (as a few ruthless individuals out there would be sure to exploit it for their evil schemes!), but in three specific cases we can be more precise: hits from Flame Cannons, Warpfire Throwers and Salamanders&apos; ranged attacks all count as Flaming Attacks._
