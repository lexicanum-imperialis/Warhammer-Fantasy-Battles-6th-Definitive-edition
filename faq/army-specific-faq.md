Q. Can a unit of Knights led by a Grand Master (making them
Immune to Psychology) carry and get the benefit of having the
Banner of Sigismund (making them stubborn)?

A. There is no magic versus mundane trump anymore. In the
example you give, the bannerwould have no effect - Immune to
Psychology is Immune to Psychology. If it were otherwise,
you’d get situations where a player could say "My Dread Banner
is a magical fear and so therefore overrules your mundane
immunity," which of course is not the case.
[Digital Engine Note: The Norn Consensus has further clarified this interaction. While the Banner of Sigismund (Magic Item) does not stack with ItP, innate abilities like Marks, Sacred Spawnings, Virtues and Vows do. Refer to The Norn Consensus in Part 3 for the specific mechanical resolution.]

Q. In a situation where an Empire unit with the Griffon Banner
and a Warrior Priest defeats an enemy unit it hates (Chaos,
Skaven, etc.) must they pursue the enemy or does the Griffon
Banner's "No pursuit" restriction take precedence?  Or do we
D6 it each time it comes up?

Hatred indicates that the unit 'must always pusue' and the
Griffon banner states 'will never pusue'.

A. The way I've dealt with this in the past is to add the
phrase 'if normally allowed to do so' on the end of 'must'
movement - i.e. the Griffon Banner's restriction means that
they do not pursue.

*****

Q. How many times may an Empire character armed with the Dragon
Bow fire in the Shooting phase?

A. Once.  Unless otherwise mentioned each model can only make
one shooting attack in each Shooting phase.  There has been
some confusion regarding this item as the Special Character
Valmir Von Raukov on the GW website may fire the Dragon Bow
three times in the Shooting phase.  Note however that Von
Raukov is allowed to do this due to his "Master Archer" ability
and this is not a property of the Dragon Bow.
S. Rulebook page 58 / Empire Army Book page 30

*****

Q. How many times may an Empire Pistolier fire in the Shooting
phase?

A. Once. Unless otherwise mentioned each model can only make
one shooting attack in each Shooting phase.  The Pistoliers
special "Fusillade" rule which allows them to use both pistols
only applies in the first turn of each close combat.
S. Rulebook page 58 / Empire Army Book page 10

*****

Q. The repeater pistol works like a regular pistol for close
combat (except it gives 3 extra attacks instead of 1). Does
it also have the same "bonuses" for shooting, i.e., no long
range or movement penalty?

A. Yes.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. What is the correct point cost for Empire Pistoliers 19 or
17? (17 is from an errata correction in the Spanish WD)

A. 19
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. Can a mounted character use two pistols, or a sword and a
pistol in close combat?

A. No. This is a special rule for Pistoliers only. Characters
can use one pistol (though only 1 Attack can be made with the
pistol), but they cannot claim +1 Attack.. So, if a mounted
character has a pistol and 3 Attacks, he can make 3 Close Combat
attacks, one of which is with the pistol.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. The rules say that Prayers never affect steeds, which is not
the same as mounts. In the description of the various Prayers, it
often says 'affects a model', and a rider on a monstrous mount is
a single model. Could you detail when the mount is and isn’t
affected?

A. Prayers only ever affect the rider.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. When do Empire detachments declare counter-charges and move
into contact with the enemy?

A. After the enemy has finished moving ALL the chargers, but
before Remaining Moves, the Detachment can declare a counter-
charge and move into contact with the enemy.
S. Empire Army Book pages 8,9

*****

Q. Given the following:

1) An enemy unit with a width of 150mm has frontal charged an
Empire parent unit with a width of 100mm.

2) The enemy unit had "excess" charge movement of 1" or more
which it did not need to use to move into contact with the
parent unit.

3) The detachments to the parent unit are less than 1" from the
front of the parent unit.  The detachments are in a position
where they can see the flank of the enemy unit, but are still
in the front arc of the enemy unit.

Are the detachments allowed to counter-charge the enemy unit or
are they drawn into combat with the enemy unit per the Multiple
Targets rules found in Appendix 6 of the Rulebook?

A. The detachments are "drawn-in" to the combat as they have
been "drawn-in" prior to the point where the detachments could
have declared a counter-charge.  When a detachment is "drawn-in"
to a combat they are moved into contact with the enemy unit
immediately after the enemy unit contacts the parent unit and it
is determined that the detachment is required to be "drawn-in".
To avoid this, Empire players should keep their detachments at
least 1.1" back from the front of their parent units.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Rulebook page 267 /
Empire Army Book pages 8,9

*****

Q. Reading the description of the Hochland Long rifle it says
that 'any' target can be chosen and has a list of targets that
are not normally allowed to be singled out.  Would this extend
to Characters that are in units engaged in hth if you could
draw an unobstructed LOS to them or does the prohibition
against picking a target engaged in hth apply to them as well?

A. You cannot shoot enemies engaged in close combat, because
the Engineer/Marksman wouldn't risk to hit his comrades.
That rule has precedence.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. With the magic item the Rod of Power, what magic dice can be
saved? Your own Power Dice only, or your own Dispel Dice too, in
the opponents magic phase?

A. Both your own Power Dice and Dispel Dice can be saved in the
Rod of Power.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)


*****

Q. The Empire item the Steel standard says in the description
Knightly Orders only, does this mean that Knights of the White
Wolf can’t use it?

A. Knights of White Wolf may not use this banner.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can a Parent Unit have a detachment(s) of the same troop
type?  For example could a unit of 10 handgunners take 2
detachments of 5 handgunners?

A. Yes. While the introduction to the detachment rules seems
to indicate that detachments are armed differently than the
parent units, no where in the actual detachment rules does
it state that the detachments must be armed differently than
the parent.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Empire Army Book
page 8.

*****

Q. Can enemy magic items and abilities which negate one or more
attacks of a model in base to base contact (e.g. Blademaster,
Hand of Khaine, Vambraces of the Sun, Cautious Shield, etc.), be
used to negate the single S10, D6 wound attack of the Mace of
Helstrum?

A. These only reduce the number of Attacks on the profile, and have
no effect on special attacks (in this case, the Empire character may
have one less Attack, but he simply swaps his remaining attacks for
the single S10, D6 wound attack).

ARCH-LECTOR OF SIGMAR

Q. Where can I find the rules for the Lord level character, the Arch- 
Lector of Sigmar? 

A. In White Dwarf Magazine. 
S. White Dwarf Magazine (US March 2005 Issue #302)/ UK April 2005 
Issue #304) 

***** 

Q. Is the Arch-Lector of Sigmar considered "Offical Rules"? 

A. The Arch-Lector was created to go alongside the scenario with the 
the White Dwarf article, and hence that is the context for which he was intended. 
We don't believe the Arch-Lector would cause significant problems to game 
balance, and players and events organisers are free, of course, to agree to 
allow armies to field an Arch-Lector in other games (e.g. such as many events 
organisers do in the case of the Revised Lores of Magic article), if they wish. 
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team 

***** 

Q. Can the Arch-Lector of Sigmar maintain two Remains in Play prayers 
in play at the same time?  Can he use the same prayer twice in a magic 
phase? 

A. The Arch-Lector may not maintain two RiP prayers in play at the same 
time.  The wording of the prayers in the Empire army book clearly states 
that once a Warrior Priest (or Arch Lector as the case may be) attempts 
another prayer, any RiP prayers are removed from play. 

As the Arch-Lector is the Sigmarite version of the generic High Priest 
of Ulric (Ar-Ulric) found in the Cult of Ulric army list in Warhammer 
Chronicles 2004, we recommend treating the Arch-Lector in the same 
manner as the Ar-Ulric in regards to the ability to use the same prayer 
twice.  This means that the Arch-Lector may attempt each of his prayers 
up to twice per turn, but if the first attempt is successful he may 
not use that prayer again that turn.

THE STEAM TANK

Q. Where can I find the rules for the Steam Tank?

A. In Warhammer Chronicles 2004
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 48

*****

Q. What effect does an Earthshaker Cannon have on a Steam Tank?

A. It will move at half normal rate, and must first roll a 4+
before each weapon may fire.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Do Pikemen get +1 Strength when charged by a Steam Tank?

A. Yes, they do.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Does the use of a Steam Tank have to be agreed upon by both
players?

A. No.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Are the Trainee Engineers on a fighting platform vulnerable
to poison?

A. Any poisoned missile attacks that hit by rolling a 6 need
to be randomised separately. If they are randomised against
the crew they wound them automatically, but if they are
randomised against the Steam Tank they still need to roll to
damage with their Strength. In close combat there is no problem
since the enemy can attack either the Steam Tank or the
Engineers.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Would firing from a hill down at the Steam Tank count as an
above hit or is this just for attacks that lob their shot?

A. The ‘hit from above’ rule is limited to war machine attacks
like mortars, stone throwers etc, (ie, those that use the
Scatter dice) and spells such as the Comet of Casandora, Forked
Lightning, etc. It does not apply to normal missile fire, magic
missiles, cannons and other machines that do not use the
Scatter dice, or any close combat attacks (even by Giants).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Can a model ‘rebound’ wounds onto a Steam Tank (the Black
Amulet for example)?

A. No.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. If the Steam Tank is charging and its intended target flees,
can it redirect the charge?

A. Of course, if the new target has been revealed by the first
one fleeing (ie, if the Tank would not have been able to charge
it before the flight of the original target).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. What about the Toughness of the Steam Tank? Several things
use the opponent’s Toughness to decide the Strength of the
attack (for example, the Rune of Might, Dwarf Slayers, the
Sword of Heroes).

A. They don’t give any advantage to models fighting the Steam
Tank as it has no Toughness value. This applies to any attack
which uses a characteristic of the Tank (except Initiative,
as noted in the rules).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. How does a Helblaster shot work against the Steam Tank?
Do you count the total number of hits and roll separately
for each one with Strength 5 (or 4), or do you consider one
Artillery dice as one hit and the number it rolled as a wound
modifier?

A. The first solution is correct. The same applies to other
multiple shot weapons, like repeater weapons.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. It is unclear as to when the player is allowed to measure
the distance from the tank to an intended target for a
charge, or if he even has to declare a charge, an how he goes
about devoting Steam points.

Can he measure first, and then decide a) not to put steam
into movement but to shooting instead? or b) that he can
possibly back up for more impact damage? Or does he have
to make his decisions guessing all ranges?

A. You still have to declare charges, and nominate how
many Steam Points you are going for - you have to judge
how many you need.

To charge an enemy unit with a ST the Empire player must
declare a charge at an enemy unit per the normal rules, in
addition it is at this point the Empire player must declare
how many SPs he will be allocating to movement for the charge.
Note that a charging unit may not perform other moves so once
the Empire player declares the amount of SPs for the charge
that is it. Per the ST rules the Empire player may use some of
these SPs allocated to the charge to 1) Pivot on the spot to
align up to the unit he wants to charge 2) backup to gain
momentum and 3) move forward to contact the enemy.

If after the Empire player has declared a charge with the ST
the enemy player flees, the flee dice are rolled, the enemy unit
moved and the Empire player moves the ST forward towards its
intended target. If he contacts the fleeing unit it is removed
as normal. If the charge is failed, the ST has a special rule
that it still moves the full distance toward the enemy
(much like a flyer would).

If the fleeing unit revealed another unit directly in the path
of the ST and the ST had enough movement to reach it, the ST
could re-direct onto the newly revealed unit. Remember the
Empire player cannot allocate any more SPs to the ST's
movement after the original amount declared to be expended on
the charge.

*****

Q. A Steam Tank cannot normally charge skirmishers, but can
a Steam Tank charge skirmishers that are formed up in a combat?

A. Yes, the Steam Tank can charge skirmishers and individual
models if they are already locked in combat.

Q. Can a lone character on foot, or a unit of Skirmishers leave
combat with a Steam Tank voluntarily in their own turn?

Q. Do the boars pulling Orc Boar Chariots benefit from the
‘Tusker Charge’ special rule? It doesn’t seem to be mentioned.

A. Yes they do get the Tusker Charge.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. If a Goblin Doom Diver lands "among" the models of a skirmisher
unit, but not exactly on one, is the hit ignored or transferred
to the closest member of the unit ?

A. It must actually hit a model to cause any damage.

Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. When an Animosity result of "We'll Show 'em" is generated does
the Greenskin unit always have to move towards an enemy unit it
has an existing line of sight to?

A. No. The unit immediately makes a full normal move (not a
march move) towards the nearest enemy unit, regardless of whether
or not the Greenskin unit had line of sight to the enemy unit
when the result was generated.  While moving towards the nearest
enemy unit, the Greenskin unit deducts the usual penalties for
terrain, turning, etc.

*****

Q. Goblin Wolf Chariots, Goblin Rock Lobbers, Goblin Spear
Chukkas, and Goblin Doom Diver Catapults do not include
"Fear Elves" in the Special Rules section of thier Unit
Entry boxes.  Was this intentional or an oversight?

A. It was intentional.  The Orcs & Goblins Army Book states
"Note: The Fear Elves, Animosity and Hatred rules described
above only apply to goblin infantry or cavalry units, and
characters. They do not apply to war machines, Chariots,
Fanatics or Squigs who are just too crazed or brainless to care.
Only big mobs of Goblins are affected by these wayward
tendencies as they goad each other into acts of cowardice,
betrayal and petty vindictiveness."
S. Orcs & Goblins Army Book page 13

*****

Q. Does the exemption regarding "Fear Elves" still apply in
situations where a Goblin character is riding in a chariot
or has joined a war machine?

A. Yes it does.  The Rulebook states "If a character is liable
to a Terror or Fear test which doesn't apply to the rest of
the unit, he can ignore any tests."
S. Rulebook page 100

Q. Can a Gobbo artillery crew use the Orc Bully's leadership?

*****

Q. Can a character join a Squiq Herd unit?

A. No.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. How do you distribute hits from missile fire among a unit of
Squiqs, Squig Hoppers, and Night Goblins?

A. Hits from missile fire should be allocated / randomized as
appropriate.  For example if the unit consisted of 3 Squig Hoppers,
6 Squiqs, and 9 Night Goblins and was hit 6 times you would
allocate 1 to the Squiq Hoppers, 2 hits to the Squigs, and 3 to the
Night Goblins.  In cases where the allocation does not exactly work
out, roll a D6 to randomize the extra hits among the various unit
types.  For example if the unit above was only hit once you would
allocate the hit to the Squiq Hoppers on a roll of "1", to the Squigs
on a roll of "2" or "3", and to the Night Goblins on a roll of "4",
"5", or "6".

FANATICS

Q. If a Night Goblin Fanatic hits a ridden monster, who are the hits
worked out against: the rider or the monster?

A. Fanatic hits should be randomised in the same way as shooting.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. Night Goblin Fanatics can hit flyers when first released. Does
this mean that flyers cannot voluntarily pass over Fanatics without
charging, and if they charge over a Fanatic, do the flyers take hits?

A. Except when they trigger the release of the Fanatic themselves,
flyers can freely move and charge over Fanatics without being hit -
Fanatics are not known for their ability to get airborne...
S. July 2002 Q&A Update on the Warhammer Chronicles website

*****

Q. Does a frenzied unit have to charge through a Night Goblin
Fanatic, or is it allowed to stop like other units?

A. The frenzied unit must complete its charge, even if this
takes it through a Fanatic.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. Say I move a unit through forest and only one model comes out of it,
triggering a Goblin Fanatic. It says that Fanatics die the minute they
touch an obstacle, and since only one model would be exposed, would the
whole unit get hit (they're all still in the forest) by the Fanatic, or
just the single model?

A. As long as one model is hit by the Fanatic, the whole unit takes
hits.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the

*****

Q. Do hidden units (in woods, for example) trigger fanatics?

A. Yes.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the

*****

Q. Do freed squiqs or released fanatics from your own army,
trigger other fanatics in your army?

A. No, although they can hurt your troops, they are not enemies.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If the damage from a Fanatic causes a Panic test, when is the Panic
test taken?

A. Immediately.  The Fanatic rules state "If a Panic test due to
Fanatic casualties has already been taken and passed then another test
is not needed."

Note that charging units, units under compulsary movement, pursuing,
etc. will keep moving through multiple Fanatics until they have taken
enough casualties to require a panic test.  If they take it and pass
it, then they can freely continue moving through Fanatics during that
turn.

*****

Q. If Ambushing Beastmen, Dwarf Miners, etc. (or an enemy unit which
had pursued a friendly off the table in the previous turn) arrive on
a table edge that is less than 8" away from a Night Goblin unit
containing Fanatics, are the Fanatics released in a random direction?

A. Yes. The Fanatic rules indicate that if an enemy unit suddenly
appears closer than 8" to a Night Goblin unit containing Fanatics,
then the Fanatics are released in a random direction. No exceptions
are noted.

GIANTS

Q. Can items/powers that remove Attacks, such as the Hand of Khaine,
affect the Giant?

A. No. In the Giant's description his attacks are listed as
"special". Further in the detailed rules for the Giant it states that
his attacks are not considered normal.  The Giant rolls randomly for
his "special" attack (i.e. he does not choose it) and none of the
"special attacks" result in something which affect the "Attack"
characteristic.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117 / Orcs & Goblins Army Book

*****

Q. How does the Giant’s Yell and Bawl special attack affect Undead
or Daemonic units?

A. The Giant counts as winning the combat by 2, regardless of
whether its a break test, Undead, instability, etc.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. After a Giant Yells and Bawls, can he still be attacked by models
not in base to base contact with him, such as models that "fight in
ranks" in the second or subsequent ranks?

A. No.  The Yell and Bawl description states "Neither the Giant nor
models in contact with him actually fight if they have not already
done so this round, but the combat round is automatically won by the
Giant's side."  As the Giant's side automatically wins the combat,
the combat is ended at that point.

BIG 'UNS

Q.  If I want to field a unit of Big'Uns, what does "type" refer
to in the statement from the O&G book, "Whichever type of unit
you choose to upgrade you must have at least as many normal
models of that type"?

A.  Each of the four listed units is a distinct type:  Orc Boyz,
Savage Orc Boyz, Orc Boar Boyz or Savage Orc Boar Boyz.  E.g.,
in order to field a unit of 30 Orc Boyz Big'Uns, you must field at
least 30 normal Orc Boyz - either 1 unit of 30, a unit of 20 and
a unit of 10, etc. In order to field a unit of 10 Savage Orc Boar
Boyz Big'Uns, you must have at least 10 Savage Orc Boar Boyz in the
army, etc.
S. Orcs & Goblins Army Book page 6

*****

Q. If I want to field a unit of Big'Uns, do the regular models
need to all be in a single unit?

A. No. The rule states, "Whichever type of unit you choose to
upgrade you must have at least as many normal models of that type
in other units before you take the Big'Uns."  It does not state that
these need to be in the same unit.  Also, note that it does explicitly
state that the normal models are in "other units" (i.e., it is plural).
S. Orcs & Goblins Army Book page 6

*****

Q.  If I want to field a unit of Big'Uns, do the normal models of the
same type have to be armed in the same manner as the Big'Un unit?

A.  No.  The rule states, "Whichever type of unit you choose to
upgrade you must have at least as many normal models of that type
in other units before you take the Big'Uns."  It does not state that
these need to be armed in the same way.

GREENSKIN MAGIC

Q. Do you collect an extra power or dispel dice for each shaman
within range of a qualifying Orc or Goblin unit engaged in close
combat during the magic phase?

A. No.  The extra dice are generated by the units, not the shamans.
Page 27 of the Orc and Goblin book (emphasis from FAQ Council):  "For
each Orc UNIT... of 10 models or more, or each Goblin UNIT ... of 20
or more models, which is within 12" of a Shaman and engaged in close
combat, the player adds +1 Power dice to his pile in his own turn, and
+1 Dispel dice in the enemy's turn."  This clearly states that the
extra dice are generated from the units, not from the Shamans, so you
could have multiple shamans all within range of 1 qualifying unit and
you will only get +1 dice for it.
S. Orcs & Goblins Army Book page 27

*****

Q. Do fleeing shamans generate additional power or dispel dice if
within range of a qualifying Orc or Goblin unit?

A. No. It requires the the shaman to harvest it, and, while fleeing, a
wizard generally can't do anything except flee.

Q. If a greenskin shaman suffers a miscast and rolls the "2" result
on the Waaagh! miscast table, what exactly does it mean that "he
behaves like a loose squig in the compulsory movement phase"? Will
he explode if he rolls a double for his bounce distance? Also, can
he flee from an enemy charge?

A. The shaman will move like a squig (moves/bounces 2D6" in a randomly
determined direction during the compulsory movement phase) but does
not actually turn into a squig. Therefore, the shaman does not
attack like a squig or explode if he rolls a double for his bounce
distance; if he rolls a double for his bounce distance, simply move
him the specified distance.  If the shaman happens to bounce on top
of a friendly or enemy unit he will not stop or attack, but instead
bounces again.  In addition, as the shaman does not actually become a
squig, he is not immune to psychology and he may flee from an enemy
charge, but will resume moving like a squiq once he rallies and regains
freedom of movement.

Q. What happens if a successful Gork's Warpath later lands
on a unit with Magic Resistance?

A. Only a unit that is nominated as the target of the spell when
initially cast can use Magic Resistance, even if the spell later
lands on a unit with Magic Resistance.

Q. Hand of Gork - it says it can move any Orc or Goblin unit of any
type. Does this mean any unit in the army (Trolls, Giants, etc), or
does it mean just Orc/Goblin units (units of that race, including
Snotlings)?

A. The spell affects any Greenskin units - Orcs of all types,
Gobbos of all types, and Snotlings, including chariots and pump
wagons.  This spell does not affect Trolls, Giants or Dogs of
War which are not Orcs or Goblins. The same is true of the Waaagh!
spell.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. How are we suppose to interpret the wording "provided that the
target unit (they) could charge the enemy if it was the greenskin’s
Movement phase" which is present in the Little Waaagh! spell, The
Hand of Gork and the Big Waaagh! spell, Waaagh!?

A. Any conditions impacting the units that would keep them from
charging that turn also means they are not subject to the affects
of the spell.  For example, if the unit has failed an Animosity check
and is Squabbling, or rallied this turn they would not be able to
charge.  Also note that war machine crews are never allowed to charge
and thus are not subject to the affects of these spells either.

pages 28,29 / Warhammer Annual 2002 page 20

*****

Q. What happens when the Big Waaagh! spell, Waaagh! is cast and both
sides are using Orc & Goblin armies?

A. If both players have units that could charge if it were their
movement phase (see Q&A above) then do the following:

1. Determine all eligible units at the time the spell is cast and
mark them with a dice or counter.  Marking them is necessary to avoid
confusion once the enemy units start moving as units which could not
charge when the spell was cast do NOT become eligible to move simply
because enemy units subsequently move into range while working out
the spell results.

2. The player who cast the spell chooses an eligible unit of his own
and charges with it as outlined in the spell.

3. The other player chooses an eligible unit of his own and charges
with it as outlined in the spell.

4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all eligible units have charged.

SHINY STUFF

Q. If an Orc and Goblin army has both the Staff of sorcery and Mork’s

Q. If an Greenskin character armed with Porko's Pigstikka becomes
engaged in a challenge on the turn he charges, does he still receive
the additional attacks?

A. Yes.  The item states "...on the turn he charges he also gets

+3)".  The item description does not exclude the character from
gaining the additional attacks due to being engaged in a
challenge.

Q. Buzgob's knobbly staff allows you to re-roll all dice used to
cast a spell. A Night Goblin Shaman also carries mushrooms (used
to add one dice to the roll, after dices have been rolled). Does
he decide to use mushrooms before or after deciding to use the
Staff’s re-roll ? If he uses the re-roll after the mushrooms,
are the mushrooms dices re-rolled along with the basic
casting dice?

A. A Night Goblin Shaman casting a spell with the Knobbly Staff
may re-roll his casting dice. After this is done, he may choose
to use his mushrooms, but the mushroom dice may not be re-rolled
- they are not ‘true’ casting dice.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

Q. How does the Glowy Green Amulet work against Tomb Kings ?
Technically speaking, the Tomb Kings player does not roll
power dice.

A. But technically speaking, they are ‘treated as normal spells’
except that they are always cast, never Miscast and never cast
with Irresistable Force. The Glowy Green Amulet doesn’t work
against normal Bound Items, because Bound Spells don’t roll any
dice. For Tomb Kings Incantations (specifically the Incantation
of Vengeance) the player with the Glowy Green Amulet rolls the
same number of dice that the Liche Priest used to cast (ie two
against a Liche Priest, three against a High Priest), just
like against any other spell.

GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q. Can Dwarfs always march? 

A. No. While Dwarfs may march even if there are enemies normally close enough to inhibit march moves due to their Relentless rule, they follow the other 
restrictions on marching such as not being able march through difficult terrain, etc.

Q. May a Gyrocopter be affected by Poisoned Attacks?

A. Yes.

*****

Q. Does a Dwarf Engineer “count as crew” of a war machine unit he is purchased for?

A. Yes, Dwarf Engineers are unit champions and champions cannot separate themselves from their unit. Therefore they count as members of the crew for purposes of Misfires, allocating hits from shooting, etc.
S. Dwarfs Army Book pages 39, 54, 56

*****

Q. When does a Master Engineer “count as crew” of a war machine unit he has joined?

A. In the Shooting phase, only a Master Engineer acting as additional crew (i.e. actually manning the gun due to the loss of other crew members) counts as crew for purposes of Misfires. The rest of the time (including when using his 
Artillery Master ability) a Master Engineer is played like any other character 
joined to a war machine unit; that is, “they do not actually become crew" per the rulebook.
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ / Dwarfs Army Book pages 38, 39 / 
Rulebook page 118

*****

Q. Can Miners charge on the turn they arrive on the table?

A. Usually the answer to this question is No. The Dwarf army book states "In the Movement phase of the turn when they arrive, Miners can enter the battlefield from any table edge and will be treated exactly like a unit that has pursued an enemy off the table in the previous turn (see the Warhammer rulebook)."  Page 76 of the Warhammer rulebook under “Pursuit Off The Table” states: "The unit may NOT charge, as it has missed its opportunity to declare charges, but may move its full Move that turn, and it may shoot and otherwise participate in the game as normal."

Note that it is possible for a Miner unit to charge on the Turn it arrives if 
the Miner unit is granted the ability to charge in the Shooting phase via the 
Rune of Oath & Honour from the Anvil of Doom.
S. Dwarf Army Book page 36 / Rulebook page 76

*****

ANVIL OF DOOM

Q. Is a Master Engineer really allowed to entrench the Anvil of Doom?

A. Yes, as the Anvil of Doom is classified as a war machine, a Master Engineer 
may entrench it.
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ 

*****

Q. Are shooting hits against the Anvil of Doom randomised as normal for a war 
machine (e.g. 1-4 hitting the Anvil and discarded and 5-6 hitting the Dwarfs) or are all shooting hits resolved against the Dwarfs?

A. All shooting hits fall amongst the Dwarfs. The protection offered by
the Anvil is taken into account by the 4+ ward save granted to the Dwarfs
against missiles.  
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ 

*****

Q. Does the Unit Strength of the Anvil of Doom decrease if the Anvil Guards or 
Runelord is killed?  Normally the Unit Strength of a war machine is equal to the number of remaining crew.

A. No, as long as there is at least one remaining crew (including the Runelord),
the Anvil of Doom has a unit strength of 5.

*****

Q. When striking the Rune of Wrath & Ruin with the Ancient Power, do enemy units suffer the movement penalties an enemy unit suffers if the Rune is struck normally?  The text under the Ancient Power of this rune is unclear.

A. Yes. Enemy units affected by the Ancient Power of the Rune of Wrath & Ruin 
also suffer movement penalties. 
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ 

*****

Q. Is the enemy allowed to declare a charge reaction against a charge
made via the Rune of Oath and Honour?

A. Yes. The enemy is definitely allowed to make a charge reaction against 
the Rune of Oath and Honour. The exact text states "A single friendly Dwarf 
unit (but not a Gyrocopter) may make a NORMAL move (which can be a March or
Charge) in the Shooting phase."
   
A normal charge certainly allows a charge reaction and nowhere in the 
description of the Rune of Oath and Honour does it state that the enemy may not 
make a reaction / may only hold.  
S. Dwarfs Army Book page 31 / Rulebook page 45

*****

Q. Does the Rune of Wrath & Ruin have to cause casualties / unsaved
wounds on the target unit(s) in order for the movement penalty to
be applied?

A. No. Nowhere in the Rune of Wrath & Ruin does it state that casualties
must be caused in order for the movement penalty to be applied.  
    
The Rune lists the two affects that the enemy unit suffers from -
one which is the D6 S4 hits and the second is the movement penalty. 
Nowhere in the description are either made contingent on the other.

*****

WEAPON RUNES

Q. If a Runic Weapon is inscribed with both the Rune of Might and the Rune of 
Cleaving and is used against a T5+ enemy, is the Strength of the attack resolved at S9 or S10?

A. S10.  
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ

*****

Q. How does the Slayer skill work if the model is armed with a Rune of Might?

A. As noted in the description of the Slayer skill, Slayers' Strength is only 
increased after modifications for weapons.  In this situation, the Slayer's 
Strength will only be increased if his doubled Strength is still less than that 
of his opponent's Toughness (which is unlikely since that would mean the opponent's Toughness was 9 or 10!)
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 116

*****

RUNIC STANDARDS

Q. May a Master Rune be inscribed on the Standard of a unit of Hammerers, 
Longbeards, or Ironbreakers?

A. Yes, there is no rule that restricts Master Runes to the Army Battle 
Standard.
S. Games Workshop's Official Dwarfs FAQ

*****

Q. How exactly does the Dwarf Rune of Slowness work?

A. The Rune comes into play when an enemy unit declares a charge on a Dwarf unit containing a standard with this Rune.

1) The Dwarf player rolls a D6 and this is subtracted from the attacking players charge distance. 

2) The distance is measured to see if the charge is successful.  If the charge is successful then play continues as normal.

3) If the charge is not successful, then it counts a failed charge and the unit 
moves its normal move.  However, keep in mind the general rule that units must 
stay at least 1 inch apart - this means that if the charging unit's normal move is far enough that it would contact the Dwarfs anyway, then you stop the chargers 1 inch away from the Dwarf unit.
S. Dwarfs Army Book page 45 / Rulebook pages 52, 55

*****

RUNIC TALISMANS

Q. Can you use the Master Rune of Challenge to force an enemy unit to charge (or flee from) a Dwarf unit with the Master Rune of Slowness?

A. Yes.  Use of this combination is allowed.  Note that the Master Rune of 
Challenge states “The unit must be able to charge and reach the rune user or the unit he is with according to the normal rules.”  Note the term “according to the normal rules” means that the normal charge distance would be measured to determine if the Master Rune of Challenge was useable and the Rune of Slowness would not apply until after the charge was declared.

Q. May a Master Engineer with the Rune of Luck use the rune to re-roll a to hit 
roll for a Bolt Thrower he is acting as an Artillery Master for?  Also, may a 
Master Engineer with the Rune of Luck use the rune to re-roll a to wound roll for a Bolt Thrower, Cannon, or Grudge Thrower he is acting as an Artillery Master for?

A. No to all of the above.

ENGINEERING RUNES

Q. When a Grudge Thrower is inscribed with the Rune of Penetrating does the rune modify the basic strength of the hits to S5 before calculating the double 
strength hit(s) (i.e. S10) or does it modify the strength after calculating the 
double strength hit(s) (i.e. S9) ?

A. It modifies the basic strength of the hits to S5, thus the double strength 
hit(s) would be S10.

Q. Does the Rune of Reloading overrule the affects of The Rain Lord spell or other similar spells / items which state that a player must roll a D6 to ascertain if his war machine is eligible to shoot?  Does the Rune of Reloading allow a war machine to be moved and then fire in the same turn?

A.  No, the rune just overrides the rules slowing down the machine's rate of fire caused by the machine's own misfire results and the loss of crew.

*****

FORCES OF THE DWARFS

Q. If a unit of Warriors or Longbeards is upgraded to Rangers does the unit 
continue to count as part of the ratio which restricts players to not having more units of Longbeards than they have Warriors?

A. Rangers are not Warriors, so an army with Rangers in it must still include a 
unit of Warriors before it can field an unit of Longbeards.

Q. An Engineer attached to a Cannon, Bolt Thrower, or Grudge Thrower has the option to purchase a “handgun” for +5 points.  Is this “handgun” a “Dwarf Handgun” or a standard handgun as defined in the Warhammer Rulebook?

Q. If I upgrade a Troll Slayer to a Giant Slayer and also make him the Standard 
Bearer (or Musician) for the unit, whom can pick up the standard (or musical 
instrument) if he is killed ? 

A.  If a Giant Slayer is the original Standard Bearer (or musician) then only
another Giant Slayer may pick up the standard (or musical instrument).  As Troll Slayers are a separate model type they are ineligible to pick up the standard (or musical instrument).

Workshop Warhammer Forum in regards to Gors and Ungors in the same 
situation) / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. How are attacks allocated against units containing both 
Troll Slayers and multiple Giant Slayers worked out? 

A. While wounds against Champions do not carry over into the rest of the unit, 
wounds may carry over from a Champion to other Champion models if there is 
more than one Champion in the unit (as Champions are just another type of RnF 
model, albeit with slightly enhanced stats and abilities) as can be the case 
with mixed Giant Slayer  / Troll Slayer regiments. 

Thus, when declaring attacks against models in base-to-base contact, it 
is only necessary to declare which attacks are being directed toward the 
Giant Slayers and which, if any, are going toward the Troll Slayers. Wounds 
taken by the Giant Slayers in excess of those in base-to-base contact will 
carry over to other Giant Slayers in the unit unless all have been killed. 
Any wounds in excess of the number of actual Giant Slayers in the unit 
at the time the wounds are inflicted will not carry over to the 
Troll Slayers and are lost. 

This works a bit differently in regards to attacks directed toward
Troll Slayers as if enough wounds are done to kill all of the normal
rank and file (i.e. Troll Slayers), the rules specify that any excess wounds 
do carry over onto Champions (in this case, the Giant Slayers).

Q. A mixed unit of Troll Slayers and Giant Slayers is hit by a weapon 
that causes the Giant Slayers to be able to make a 'Look Out, Sir' roll. 
Does there have to be a separate Troll Slayer in the unit for each Giant
Slayer hit for the latter to receive the 'Look Out, Sir!' benefit?

A. Yes. Since hits are allocated before wounds, there have to be enough 
potential Troll Slayer candidates to actually accept the hits in place 
of their Giant Slayer brethren. If there are not enough Troll Slayers, then 
the remaining Giant Slayers are hit and cannot benefit from the 'Look Out, 
Sir!' rule.

Q. Can the Gem of Blood save against a Killing Blow? If so, is the
Killing Blow rebounded back onto the attacker?

damage, and the wound rebounded. However, just a single wound is
rebounded, not the killing blow itself.

Q. For purposes of determining if fear causing units outnumber their
foes to force an auto-break situation, do you determine it by the
largest fear causing unit engaged in the combat or do you use the
total Unit Strength of the fear causing units and compare it to the
defender’s combined Unit Strength?

A. Neither. If a unit is outnumbered by fear-causing enemies, then
it automatically breaks. Operative word is unit, not side, so it
is worked out on its Unit Strength versus total Unit Strength of
fear- causing enemies it is actually fighting (i.e. in base to base
contact with), in the same way that break test are rolled for
individually rather than per side.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. In the rules for removing rank bonus it states that "This
bonus is lost if the unit is charged in the flank or rear by
an enemy with a US of 5 or more."  This leads to the following
question: Will an Undead unit that is currently less than US5
at the time it charges the enemy and is subsequently raised
to US5+ remove the enemy's rank bonus at the start of the
first round of close combat at which the US5+ status has been
reached?

A. With a strict interpretation of the rule (and therefore
the one that keeps it closest to the basic rules), the unit
has not been 'charged' by an enemy with US 5 or more, and
therefore has not been disrupted enough to lose its rank bonus.
However, you will still get flank and rear bonuses as normal.

Q. Can a Banshee always move up to 12 inches?

A. Yes. The answer is based on the following:

1) The Banshee has a special rule called "Single Model"
which indicates that she is treated as a character on foot
for movement and when targeted by missiles.

2) The Laws of Undeath for the Vampire Counts army indicate
that a character on foot may always make march moves.

3) The Unit Strength and Single Model's Movement chart in
Warhammer Chronicles 2003 indicates that single roughly
man sized models on foot move "As Skirmishers".  Regarding
movement, units which move "As Skirmishers" have no need to
turn or wheel, can pivot on the spot with no penalty, and have a
360 degree arc of sight for charges, etc.  They do not incur
penalties for difficult terrain/obstacles, and can march even

Q. When summoning a new unit of undead with the Invocation
of Nehek do you have to nominate the location where you will
be placing them before rolling to cast/opponent tries to
dispel?

A. No. It specifically states in the spell ‘once the spell
is cast, choose any point within 18” and place one model
on it’.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can the Invocation of Nehek be used to add width to
the formation of the target unit?

A. This question is not specifically answered in the
Vampire Counts Army book, but has been answered in the
Tomb Kings Army Book under Djedra's Incantation of
Summoning (which we recommend adopting for use with
the Invocation of Nehek) as follows:  "Rank and file models
are added to the front rank until the front rank reaches at
least four models.  Then additional models may be added to
either the front rank or they can be added to create rear
ranks. If the unit already has more than one rank, new models
can only be added to rear ranks."

Q. A Necromancer cast Invocation of Nehek and raised a
new unit consisting of 7 Skeletons. Later in that same
magic phase, a Master Necromancer cast Invocation of Nehek
at the newly raised unit and added 11 additional models
to the unit bringing it to a total of 18 skeletons.  Is
the Victory points value of the new unit based on the
initial 7 Skeletons or the total of 18 Skeletons?

A. The Victory points value of the new unit is based on
the initial 7 Skeletons.  Invocation of Nehek indicates
to immediately calculate and record the Victory points
value of the new unit when it is created.

UNHOLY ARTEFACTS

Q. Does the Black Periapt allow you to store one of your
opponent's unused magic dice?

and make use of it in the next one.

Q. What happens when you have a Vampire Counts unit with the
Banner of the Barrows (Wights always hit on 3+) in a combat
vs. an enemy unit which require sixes to hit it (e.g. an enemy
unit defending an obstacle, Dryads, etc.)?

A. This is a case of an "irresistible force" vs. an "immovable
object". In other words, roll a D6 each close combat round to see
whether the Wights hit on a 3+ or need sixes to hit.

Q. Vampires and armour: Necrarch and Lahmian Vampires can't wear

armours? Can you specify which armours each Bloodline can wear?

or Magical.

WIGHT BLADES

Q. Do Wights on foot armed with Wight Blades and mundane
shields qualify for the hand weapon and shield bonus in
close combat?

A. Yes.  "Wight Blades" is actually a special rule which
applies to the various types of mundane weapons that the
Wights carry. If Wights on foot choose to use their hand
weapons along with mundane shields, they qualify for the
bonus.
S. Vampire Counts Army Book page 27 / Rulebook page 88

*****

Q. How do magic items which negate the affects of magical
weapons interact with Wight Blades?

A. "Wight Blades" is actually a special rule which
applies to the various types of mundane weapons that the
Wights carry.

The Wight Blades special rule indicates that the mundane
weapons carried by the Wights all have the the Killing
Blow special ability attached to them.

The Wight Blades special rule also makes the mundane
weapons carried by Wights count as "magical" for purposes
of being able to wound ethereal creatures, able to hit
certain characters who are protected by magical armour,
etc. but they still retain their mundane property.

So a magical item which negates the affects of magical
weapons would stop the attacks from Wights counting as
"magical", but would not stop the Killing Blow ability
attached to them.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Vampire Counts
Army Book page 27

*****

Q. How does the High Magic spell, Vaul's Unmaking affect
Wight Blades?

A. It doesn't. Vaul's Unmaking only affects Magic Items.
Wight Blades are not magic items.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Vampire Counts
Army Book page 27

*****

Q. How do spells which destroy mundane weapons, such as the
Lore of Metal spell, Bane of Forged Steel (as amended
in Warhammer Chronicles 2004), affect Wights?

A. As the "Wight Blades" special rule states that the
Killing Blow and the ability of the weapons to count as
magical are attached to the mundane weapons carried by the
Wights, the Wights would no longer benefit from either of
those special rules.

In additon, as they would be striking with their fists,
they would not receive any strength bonuses from weapons
or be able to receive the +1 Armour Save bonus for using
a hand weapon and shield.

Standard Bearer's number comes up on the Intrigue at Court roll, then
he is indeed the army's General.

Note that it is still illegal for a High Elf army to field a Battle
Standard Bearer as the only character.  If the High Elf player rolls

Q. When a unit sustains 25% or more casualties from friendly fire
(e.g. from Skaven Life is Cheap fire, scattering template weapons,
etc.) does the unit have to take a Panic check at the end of the
phase?

A. That would come under 'voluntary tests'. By the strict letter of
the rules, only casualties in the enemy magic and shooting phases
apply. However, as well known, friendly fire isn't friendly at all,
and I would probably take a panic test if one of my units suffered
self-inflicted casualties in this way.

*****

Q. When a war machine unit, Skaven Weapons Team, wizard, etc.
destroys itself via a misfire, malfunction, miscast, etc. do
friendly units within 4" have to take a Panic check at the end of
the phase?

A. No test required. The panic test for friends destroyed is very
specific about enemy magic and shooting again. In this case, most
soldiers are just waiting for the wizard's head to explode or
the whirly-gun of doom to blow itself up. They're pretty used to
this type of behaviour.

include the originally intended target and giving the a 75% chance

the same limitations as targeting lone characters". Does the use of
the word "magic" in this context refer to "Magic Missiles" (e.g. was
Alessio trying to just remind players to treat magic missiles as
shooting) or magic in general (e.g. does this exempt Skaven weapon
teams from being targeted by spells such as Forked Lightning, etc.)

A. If a spell/ magic item has particular abilities/ limitations
against lone characters, these apply to weapon teams as well. It does
not mean apply the shooting rules to magic.  Skaven weapon teams may
be targeted by spells such as Forked Lightining, etc. as normal.

WARP-LIGHTNING CANNON

Q. Can you declare a charge on a Warp-lightning Cannon from anywhere
and force it to flee?

A. No. The rules say you can't declare charge if you're not
relatively confident to reach the target.
S. Alessio Cavatore - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook page 265

*****

Q. How do you resolve a hit from the Warp-lightning Cannon vs. a
model with multiple parts?

A. In the description of the Warp-lightning Cannon it
states "Determine which MODELS are hit in the same way as you would
do for the bounce of a cannon ball, except that all MODELS (friends
and foe) lying along the entire line's length are hit. There is not
need to randomize hits if the line goes through MODELS engaged with
close combat with the enemy, all MODELS lying under the line are hit,
as simple as that (note that this is an exception to the normal rules
for shooting in close combat)"

The cannon rules state: "If a cannonball hits a MODEL with several
parts then resolve which part of the MODEL is hit just as shooting
with bows, etc."

This means that if the Warp-lightning Cannon hits a character riding
a monster it must randomize as normal (1-4 monster, 5-6 character)
and if it hits a chariot it must randomize as normal (1-5 chariot, 6
character).
S. Skaven Army Book page 29 / Rulebook pages 103,122,127

*****

Q. Is the Skaven crew of a Warp-lightning Cannon assumed to always
have LOS to the Casket of Souls (since they can see anywhere on the
battlefield) or can the Skaven player pick and choose when the crew
is looking through the cannon sight? In the same vein, does it mean
enemy scouts cannot use their Scouting rule?

A. No, and no. The cannon is assumed to be able to see through
terrain during the shooting phase only. At all other times, it
counts as conforming to normal line of sight rules.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Is the Skaven Warp-lightning Cannon a missile attack, and so
can be stopped by an anti-missile magic item (i.e. Banner of Doom
or special ward saves)

A. Yes.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Does the Warp-lightning Cannon count as a war machine or chariot
for things like deployment and Unit Strength.

A. A war machine with three crew.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. What happens if the Warp-lightning Cannon is forced to become
engaged in combat, such as if the Slaanesh spell Delicious
Excruciation was cast on them (making them Unbreakable, and as
such unable to flee from a charge)?

A. If for any reason the Warp-lightning Cannon is engaged in
combat, it is immediately destroyed (and the enemy unit can overrun
as normal).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. Does the Warp-lightning Cannon affects 1 model per rank (or row)
only, like a regular cannon, or all models the line touches ?

A. As a cannon.

Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

TUNNELING TEAMS

Q. What happens if a Tunneling Team emerges directly below a Fear or
Terror causing enemy unit and fails its Fear / Terror test?

A. It doesn't need to take a Fear or Terror test, as it will
"automatically engage it in close combat on the side closest to the
marker(the team counts as charging)". As it "automatically engages",
it does not need to take a fear or Terror test.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Does a Tunneling Team need to test for Terror if it emerges close
to a Terror causing creature? (Both testing for Terror and emerging
from tunnels happen at the start of the turn, so which one occurs
first?)

A. Yes, an emerging Tunneling Team must take Terror tests on the
turn they arrive. You could imagine it would be rather unnerving to
emerge from a hole and find yourself at a Dragon's feet...
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Can a unit of Gutter Runners which purchased the Tunneling
ability elect to not use the ability and deploy as Scouts?

A. Yes they may deploy as Scouts.  In the Tunneling description
it states they "can" use their Tunneling ability, it
doesn't say they "must".  As all Gutter Runners are classified as
Scouts, Tunneling Teams retain the ability to Scout.
S. Skaven Army Book page 19

MAGIC OF THE HORNED RAT

Q. Can a Grey Seer cast non-LOS spells when leading from the back?

A. Yes, you can cast spells that do not require seeing the target.
S. Alessio Cavatore - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If Warp-Lightning is cast, but then found to be out of range, can
the caster still accidentally wound himself?

A. Yes. In this case, the roll to see how many hits are caused should
still be made – any roll of 1 will hit the caster, any other roll is
ignored.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. What happens if Death Frenzy is cast upon a fleeing unit?

A. The unit will continue to flee. However, if the unit rallies, it
will then count as being frenzied.

*****

Q. If you die from using a Warpstone Token but successfully cast the
spell, would the effects of the spell still go off?

A. Best thing to do would be to roll a dice for it. Sometimes a spell
is cast, sometimes not...

TOOLS OF SUPREMACY

Q. Can a Skaven character take multiple Warpstorm Scrolls or Warp
Scrolls?  Can a Skaven army include multiple Warpstorm Scrolls or
Warp Scrolls?

A. A single character may only take one of these scrolls as
their description classifies them as "Bound Spells" and
a character cannot have more than one Bound Spell item.  Note
however that as they are also classified as Scrolls, you can take
both a Warpstone or Warp Scroll and another Arcane Item. Also, as
opposed to ordinary magic items, every Grey Seer or Warlock in the
army can bring a Warpstone Scroll or Warp Scroll to the battle, as
Scrolls are not considered to be unique.

Q. Can you buy a Warpstone Token for a Plague Priest with the Liber
Bubonicus?

A. Yes - with the Liber Bubonicus, he becomes a wizard (and so can
use items from the Arcane Items list.)

Q. Would the Umbranner's Ward save kick in against a Bolt Thrower
after it has successfully gone through two ranks (down to Strength 4)?

A. Yes.

*****

Q. Do you roll for the Storm Banner to burn out every player turn (I
trigger it at the beginning of my turn, then roll for it burning out
at the beginning of your next turn, then my next, etc), or just on
each of my turns? I note that in the Skaven battle report on the
site, it appears as if it is the latter option.

A. It is rolled every player's turn.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. What is the correct description of the Storm Banner?

A. One use only.  This ancient and tattered banner has the power to
wrack the sky with storms, tearing the heavens apart with its fury.

The banner can be activated at the beginning of any player's turn.
No flying movement is allowed and all missile fire is at -2 to hit.
All war machines and other ranged attacks that do not use BS may
only fire if the player first rolls a 4+ on a D6 (roll for each
model). Magic missiles and other ranged spells are not affected.
Roll a D6 at the beginning of each player's subsequent turns - on
a roll of 1 or 2, the power of the banner is exhausted and it no
longer has any effect for the remainder of the battle.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 126

*****

Q. Do the corrected Storm Banner rules mean that Ratling guns,
Warpfire throwers and Warp-lightning cannons only work on a 4+?

A. Yes, since the text doesn’t mention enemy only, and they are
warmachines that don’t use BS.

SCREAMING BELL

Q. On a Skaven Screaming Bell result of 8 or 13 do you treat the
Tomb Kings army as if the Hierophant, and not the General, has been
destroyed?

A. Yes.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Does an Undead General (Hierophant) have to test under a result
of 13 on the Screaming Bell chart?

A. No, as the General (Hierophant) is a character, and Undead
characters never suffer wounds because of a dead General
(Hierophant).
S. warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. If the Screaming Bell rolls 16, are units not yet on the table
(tunnelers, pursuing out of the table units) affected?

A. No, as they are not on the battlefield when the effect takes
place.
S. warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. If your Grey Seer riding the Screaming Bell is killed, is there
any reason why the striker can't continue to ring the bell?

A. No, the striker can continue to hit the bell.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. Can a Grey Seer on a Screaming Bell use a Warpstone Charm to re-
roll the roll for ringing the Screaming Bell?

A. No. It is not directly affecting the Grey Seer - he is not the one
ringing the bell!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 117

*****

Q. If a Bolt Thrower killed a Grey Seer on a Screaming Bell, or
destroyed the Screaming Bell, would the bolt continue through the
ranks of Clanrats?

A. No, as the shooter could choose to aim at the unit OR the large
target (the Screaming Bell and the Grey Seer). The Screaming Bell and
the Clanrats are two separate targets (though a Cannon could hit
both).

8. HORDES OF CHAOS

+++++

Q. Can I have a daemonic character in my mortal army even though
its Leadership value is higher than my mortal General's Leadership
value?

A. No. Chaos armies are not exempt from the main rule that the
character with the highest Leadership value must be the General.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Hordes of Chaos
Army Book page 55 / Rulebook page 102

*****

Q. Can daemons use the Chaos General's Leadership value for
Instability tests?

A. Yes they can.

From Page 102 of the main Rulebook "Any unit within 12" of the
General model may use the General's Leadership value instead of its
own when making a Leadership-based test..."

On page 29 of Hordes of Chaos while discussing Instability
tests it states "Roll 2D6 and compare this to the daemons'
Leadership value, with no combat resolution modifiers..."

Nowhere in Hordes of Chaos does it state that the General's Ld
value may not be used and in fact the specific wording used by the
design team (as shown above) makes it clear that daemons may use
the Ld value of the General for Instability tests.
S. Hordes of Chaos Army Book page 29 / Rulebook page 102

*****

Q. Does a Chaos Battle Standard Bearer allow daemonic units to
re-roll Instability tests?

A. No.  Daemons don't get the benefit of the Battle Standard
Bearer re-roll due to the instability test *not* being a break
test (Instability test is made instead of a break test).

Q. What happens if a unit of Tzeentch Screamers makes a slashing
attack on a unit that does automatic hits, like a Night Goblin
Fanatic?

A. Both units inflict and take damage.  In the example of the
Fanatic, the Screamers take D6 S5 hits and simultaneously each
do a S3 hit on the Fanatic.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. What is the unit strength of a Chaos Warhound and are Chaos
Warhounds a ranked unit?

Q. Are each of the heads of a Chaos Dragon allowed to pick a
different target? Or is the model bound by the normal rules for
shooting?

A. It is bound by the normal rules for shooting. If there is a unit
which can be reached by both breath weapons, the Chaos Dragon cannot
Divide Shots. Otherwise (i.e., no unit can be reached by both breath
weapons) the Divide Shots rule applies and the breath weapons can
attack different targets.

Q. Can a mortal Chaos character mounted on a daemonic steed
join a unit of daemons?

A. No. Only a mortal character with the Chalice of Chaos

Non-daemonic models may not join a daemonic unit.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Hordes of Chaos
Army Book page 29

*****

Q. When a mortal Chaos character mounted on a daemonic steed
and joined to a mortal unit is killed, what happens to the
daemonic steed?

A. At the end of the phase in which the mortal Chaos character
is killed, the daemonic steed is separated from the mortal
unit (you might like to place him 1" away to make sure this is
clear).  If the daemonic steed is involved in combat when the
character is killed, place it so it remains in base to base
contact with the enemy. In addition, remember to take a Slain
Rider test and generate a Monster Reaction if the test is
failed.

Q. How do you resolve a combat where the attacker is entitled to
re-roll missed hits (e.g. Hatred) and the defending Chaos character
is wearing the Armour of Damnation (which forces the attacker to

CHAOS MAGIC

Q. When an enemy unit is affected by Green Fire of Tzeentch and
strike themselves, does the unit use its main weapon (caster
basically chooses), or does the owner of the unit get to choose?
For example, if a unit is equipped with great weapons and shields,
would they use the great weapons (caster's choice) or hand weapon
and shield (owners choice)?

A. Caster’s choice.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. If casting the Tzeentch spell Green Fire on a unit of swordsmen can
the caster freely choose what equipment the combat is fought with? To
specify can it be cast on a unit of Empire swordsmen that then elect
to only use their hand weapons not using the shields?

A. The caster chooses which weapon to attack with. The Swordsmen will
defend themselves as best they can though, so they would use their
shields. However, if a unit was armed with halberd and shield, the
caster may choose for them to attack with the halberd, so they could
not use their shields to defend with, as they are using a two-handed
weapon.

Q. How does the spell Green Fire of Tzeentch work against a Beast

*****

Q. Do spells from the Lore of Tzeentch (which are all named as a
different color of fire) count as 'Fire' attacks?

A. No they do not.  None of the Tzeentch spells include the
wording "This is a Fire attack and causes double damage against
flammable targets" as pure flaming spells do. This was confirmed
via the High Elf Q&A for Dragon Armour which states that models
with Dragon Armour are NOT immune to Tzeentch spells.

*****

Q. The Titillating Delusions spell. May an affected unit still
declare charges against units in LOS but not on the line designed
by the spell? What about frenzied units who are forced to declare
charges when possible? If a unit is affected, is it considered
"immune to psychology", or can psychology effects alter their
movement? Can you choose to flee from a charge, away from the
direction nominated by the spell? If you cast a magical movement
spell or incantation at an affected unit, can you freely choose
the direction or are you forced to move the unit in the direction
given by the Delusions spell?

A. The thing affected by the spell is the unit's voluntary movements:
all voluntary movement, including those that result from a spell or
incantation, even charge declarations, have to be made in the
direction given by the delusions spell. This includes the voluntary
direction that Spawn and Pump Wagons move in. However, the affected
unit is not Immune to Psychology, and all compulsory movement still
obeys its own rules (compulsory charges, failed terror tests, etc.).
The unit can still flee a charge, but will still be affected by the
spell as soon as it regains its freedom of movement.

Q. For purposes of determining if fear causing units outnumber their
foes to force an auto-break situation, do you determine it by the
largest fear causing unit engaged in the combat or do you use the
total Unit Strength of the fear causing units and compare it to the
defender’s combined Unit Strength?

A. Neither. If a unit is outnumbered by fear-causing enemies, then
it automatically breaks. Operative word is unit, not side, so it
is worked out on its Unit Strength versus total Unit Strength of
fear- causing enemies it is actually fighting (i.e. in base to base
contact with), in the same way that break test are rolled for
individually rather than per side.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. In the rules for removing rank bonus it states that "This
bonus is lost if the unit is charged in the flank or rear by
an enemy with a US of 5 or more."  This leads to the following
question: Will an Undead unit that is currently less than US5
at the time it charges the enemy and is subsequently raised
to US5+ remove the enemy's rank bonus at the start of the
first round of close combat at which the US5+ status has been
reached?

A. With a strict interpretation of the rule (and therefore
the one that keeps it closest to the basic rules), the unit
has not been 'charged' by an enemy with US 5 or more, and
therefore has not been disrupted enough to lose its rank bonus.
However, you will still get flank and rear bonuses as normal.

Q. Do Skeleton spearmen in the second rank get to fight when the
Incantation of Righteous Smiting is cast upon the unit?

A. No. The Incantation of Righteous Smiting explicitly says
"models in base-to-base contact".

*****

Q. Incantations vs Drain Magic. Can an incantation be cast at a
power level of 0 or lower? If so, is it automatically dispelled by
the opponent if he wishes to, or is a D6 roll still necessary ?

A. An incantation is always cast, regardless of its power level.
The opponent must still spend one of his dispel dice to dispel
the incantation. However, the result will automatically be higher
than 0 and the incantation will be dispelled.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. A Tomb King/Tomb Prince is not listed as a Wizard (he can’t
take arcane items, and doesn’t generate dispel dice). Can he
still be a target for Drain Magic?

A. No, as he isn’t a wizard. It is more his indomitable will that
forces his minions to perform his bidding rather than ‘magic’ in
the normal sense. In a similar vein, Drain Magic cannot be cast
against Settra.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Can a Tomb Kings army take advantage of a "4" result for a
Miscast by an enemy wizard?  A "4" result on the Miscast table
allows one of the opponent's wizards to have a "free" casting of
any spell that has a casting difficulty equal to or less than the
spell that was Miscast.

A. No. A Tomb Kings army cannot take advantage of magical powers
from such things as an enemy Miscast.

Q. In a Tomb Kings army that includes Dogs of War or
Regiments of Renown units, do the DoW / RoR units have to
take panic checks for the destruction of nearby Undead
units?

A. Yes.  No exemption to taking panic checks for DoW / RoR
units has been granted in the Tomb Kings Army Book.
While the units may be "Undead" they are still considered
"friendly" units for purposes of Panic.

*****

Q. Is it legal for a living character, such as a Dark Emissary,
to join an Undead unit? Likewise, is it legal for an Undead
character to join a living unit, such as Dogs of War pikemen?

A. The intention of the rules is that no, Undead units cannot be
joined by non-Undead characters and vice versa.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If the Tomb Kings hire a Dark Emissary or Truthsayer, when do
they cast their magic within the hierarchy?

A. As long as they don't disturb the hierarchy, they can cast at
any time, before or after it, but never during.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

CHARIOTS

Q. How do you resolve challenges involving the Champion of a
Chariot unit?

A. If the Chariot is charging, any impact hits are worked out
against the unit as with other challenges.  However, except for
the impact hits, the chariot takes part in the challenge as a
single model, so all crew and steeds fight in the challenge.
This is necessary as there is no separate Wound for the
Champion himself and so attacks against him cannot be separated
out.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Does a charging chariot unit cause impact hit for ALL of its
chariots, or only the ones that are in base-to-base contact ?

A. Only the chariots that are in base-to-base contact can cause
impact hits.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. While he is with a Chariot unit, if I kill a Tomb King or Tomb
Prince's chariot, he becomes separated from the unit at the end
of the phase.  If this happens in close combat, does he become
an independent character before or after combat resolution?  If
the Khemri unit wins and the opponent flees, does the Tomb King
and Chariot unit pursue together or separately?

A. Both combat resolution and pursuing/fleeing happen before the
end of the phase, so the character would count as part of the
unit (unfortunately, this would also mean the Chariots only pursue
2D6" because his Movement value is not more than 6").
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Can you resurrect a Tomb Kings character's chariot if it has
been destroyed but the character is still 'alive'?

A. No. The character and his chariot are treated separately. Neither
can you resurrect the character if the chariot is still 'alive'!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. If a Tomb King character riding a chariot is killed is the
chariot automatically destroyed as it has no crew?

A. No.  Per Gav's answer in the above Q&A the character and
the chariot are treated separately.

*****

Q. If I destroy a Tomb Kings character's chariot, but not the
character do I earn victory points for destroying the chariot

whichever parts you destroy (the character, the chariot, or both).

SCREAMING SKULL CATAPULT

Q. If a Screaming Skull Catapult engaged in close combat loses,
but doesn’t lose all its crew, can the additional wounds suffered
from combat resolution be allocated to the Catapult itself rather
than the crew?

A. Yes.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

Q. If a Screaming Skull Catapult has lost all its crew, can they
be brought back with the Incantation of Summoning, so long as
the Catapult itself is still standing?

BONE GIANT

Q. How many attacks does a Bone Giant have, including his second
weapon?

A. 5. He has 4 Attacks in his profile and gets an extra 1 with
the second weapon.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. How does the Bone Giant’s Unstoppable Assault work against the
Steam Tank, castle walls and other targets that don’t have Wounds?

A. It has no affect at all; if the target does not have a Wounds
characteristic, there’s no life force for the Bone Giant to feed on!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

Q. If the Incantation of Righteous Smiting is cast on a charging
Bone Giant, can he use the unstoppable assault rule?

TREASURES OF THE NECROPOLIS

Q. Do hits from the Destroyer of Eternities which hit each model

Q. Can you use the Banner of the Undying Legion to restore wounds
to a character that has joined the unit ?

A. No, it only affects the unit.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can a unit charge on the turn it is raised by the Banner of the
Hidden Dead? Can the banner still be used if the Icon Bearer is
killed before the unit is revealed?

A. As the banner states, they appear in the Remaining Moves part of
the turn, which is AFTER charges have been declared. When the Magic
phase rolls around, however... If the bearer is killed, you can’t
activate the power of the banner and the unit won’t appear in this
battle. Your opponent does not get victory points for the missing
unit though.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

Q. Can an Icon Bearer take the Icon of Rakaph?  The description of
the item seems to indicate it may only be used by Tomb Guard
and Skeleton Warriors.

A. Yes, the Icon Bearer may take the Icon of Rakaph.  This is
actually the only way that Skeleton Warriors can benefit from it
(Skeleton Warriors may only have a banner that is up to 25 points
and the Icon of Rakaph is 40 points).

TOMB BLADES

Q. Do models on foot armed with Tomb Blades and mundane
shields qualify for the hand weapon and shield bonus in
close combat?

A. Yes.  "Tomb Blades" is actually a special rule which
applies to the various types of mundane weapons that the
models carry. If these models on foot choose to use their hand
weapons along with mundane shields, they qualify for the
bonus.
S. Tomb Kings Army Book page 27 / Rulebook page 88

*****

Q. How do magic items which negate the affects of magical
weapons interact with Tomb Blades?

A. "Tomb Blades" is actually a special rule which
applies to the various types of mundane weapons that the
models carry.

The Tomb Blades special rule indicates that the mundane
weapons carried by the models all have the the Killing
Blow special ability attached to them.

The Tomb Blades special rule also makes the mundane
weapons carried by these models count as "magical" for
purposes of being able to wound ethereal creatures, able to
hit certain characters who are protected by magical armour,
etc. but they still retain their mundane property.

So a magical item which negates the affects of magical
weapons would stop the attacks from these models counting as
"magical", but would not stop the Killing Blow ability
attached to them.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Tomb Kings
Army Book page 27

*****

Q. How does the High Magic spell, Vaul's Unmaking affect
Tomb Blades?

A. It doesn't. Vaul's Unmaking only affects Magic Items.
Tomb Blades are not magic items.
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation / Tomb Kings
Army Book page 27

*****

Q. How do spells which destroy mundane weapons, such as the
Lore of Metal spell, Bane of Forged Steel (as amended
in Warhammer Chronicles 2003), affect models armed with
Tomb Blades?

A. As the "Tomb Blades" special rule states that the
Killing Blow and the ability of the weapons to count as
magical are attached to the mundane weapons carried by the
models, the models would no longer benefit from either of
those special rules.

In additon, as they would be striking with their fists,
they would not receive any strength bonuses from weapons
or be able to receive the +1 Armour Save bonus for using
a hand weapon and shield.

CASKET OF SOULS

Q. What happens if an enemy unit with Magic Resistance is in
line of sight of the Casket when its incantation is released?
Do you really add the Magic Resistance dice to the Dispel roll
(and very easily screw up the incantation)? More generally, if one
of the targets for the Casket has a special ability against spells
(magic resistance, rebound, dice stealing, casting score reducing),
does it apply to the whole Casket’s spell effect?

A. Magic Resistance does work against the Casket’s Light of Death,
so long as the model/unit with Magic Resistance would be affected.
Where there is more than one unit with Magic Resistance that will
be affected, only one model/unit can add their extra dice (usually
the highest). In all other respects, the Light of Death counts
as magic that affects any enemy unit that can see the Casket,
so other effects would also work as they would against any other
magic. Having said that however, a magic item that ‘rebounds’
spells isn’t going to have any effect - the Light of Death only
ever affects enemies.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. Are enemy units which are involved in close combat, but still
have line of sight to the Casket of Souls, affected by the Light
of Death?

A. The Casket does not affect units that are engaged in combat at
all. It is assumed that they are engrossed in the combat, and so
will never be affected.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Are any types of units immune to the affects of the Casket of
Souls?

A. No.  The Casket of Souls gives no exceptions to what it affects.
The Light of Death affects everything including Undead, Daemons,
troops immune to psychology, and even war machines.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. How do you resolve wounds from the Casket of Souls against a war
machine? Is the machine itself affected or only the crew?

A. Randomise wounds between crew and machine as you would for
missile hits.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can you use the General’s Leadership value (if in 12" range) when
determining the number of wounds from the Casket of Souls?

A. Yes.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. How are skirmishers and lone characters on foot (360° line of
sight) affected by the Casket of Souls?

A. Just like everybody else!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Fast cavalry can shoot all round, so does this mean they have
360° line of sight for the purposes of the Casket of Souls?

A. No, as described in the rules for fast cavalry, they use normal
line of sight for everything except shooting.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. How far can the Liche Priest go away from the Casket of Souls
without being considered out of range from it?

A. A model must remain within 1" of a war machine (or in this case
the Casket of Souls) to count as being part of its ‘crew’.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can another Liche Priest join the Casket (the same way a
character can join a warmachine crew)? If so what happens if the
original Liche Priest is killed? Can the other Liche Priest sustain
the casket?

A. Yes. In the description for the Casket (p. 33) it says ‘If...
there is no Liche Priest or Liche High Priest acting as part of the
crew for the Casket at the beginning of any Tomb Kings turn, the
Casket and its two Casket Guards immediately collapse...’. It
doesn’t say anything about the original Liche Priest - as long as
there is at least one Priest acting as crew it operates as normal.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Is it true that when fighting in close combat the Priest joins
the first rank and personally defends the casket?

A. Yes, a Priest must fight in the combat. The Priest and his
bodyguards form up like war machine crew.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can a character with the Collar of Shapesh and within 6" of a
Casket of Souls redirect wounds to the Casket itself (and therefore
have them ignored)?

A. No, it must be redirected to a model with a Wounds
characteristic.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS

Q. Settra’s armour of Golden Magnificence. Do weapons or spells
that nullify armour saves work or is it like a second 4+ ward save?
Oh, and is the 2+ armour save improved by +2 with the chariot?

A. As stated, he is allowed a 4+ save even against attacks that
normally allow no save, and yes this is in addition to his ward
save. No, he always has a 2+ armour save, whether mounted or not.

Q. What is the correct description for the Stegadon's Giant Bow?

A. "Giant Bow: The giant bow is a Bolt Thrower, using all of the
rules for Bolt Throwers on pages 124-125 of the Warhammer
rulebook with the following exceptions: The giant bow is fired
using the Skinks' Ballistic Skill, and inflicts a single S5 hit
thi that does D3 wounds.  The giant bow can move and fire,
although it can only fire in the arc of sight of the Stegadon
itself.  It takes two crew to fire the giant bow (so two Skinks
can't throw javelins if they are crewing the giant bow). As the
Stegadon is a large target, the giant bow may shoot over normal
sized models and interposing terrain that large targets can see
over."

Q. Does the "Predatory Fighters" rule imply that one of the two Saurus
Attacks is made without a weapon bonus? Temple Guard have 2 Attacks
but not the Predatory fighters rule, so does it mean that they have 2
Attacks, both with the halberd bonus? What about characters?

A. Predatory Fighters, simply put, is only meant for Saurus armed
with spears, and says that the second rank has only 1 attack. In all
other cases, use the Attack value indicated with any weapon bonuses -
that's why Temple Guards and Characters do not have this rule.

Q. How does the Kroxigor’s rule ‘Skirmish Screen’ work with Skink
units that are in combat already? Can you charge through them as well?
Also, can Kroxigors charge through units of Skink Cohorts, or Horned
One Riders?

A. Kroxigors can only charge through Skirmishers (hence the name
Skirmish Screen). They can’t charge through ranked up units, and
can’t charge through skirmishers that are engaged in combat at all.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. If I field a Skink Character riding a Stegadon, may I take
stubborn break tests using the leadership of the Skink character?

unit may utilize the stubborn character's leadership value for break
tests.

*****

Q. Can a Lizardmen player store unused magic dice in the Diadem of
Power before the Vampire Counts' magic item the Black Periapt, steals
an unused dispel dice or power dice?

A. The only differences between these two items is that the second
allows you to save and store one dice from either players dice pool
and the first allows you to save and store two dice but only from
the Lizardmen player's dice pool.  Neither says they happen before
the other. This is a case of an "irresistible force" vs. an
"immovable object". In other words, roll a D6 each time there are
unused dice by the Lizardmen player to see which player gets to store
dice first.

Q. Can a unit or character have the same Blessed Spawning twice?
Eg, can my Saurus Warriors take two Blessed Spawnings of Quetzl to

Q. Do Blessed Spawnings affect ridden creatures as well as the rider?

A. They are not affected except where noted (Blessed Spawning of
Chotec).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Why does the Blessed Spawning of Huanchi cost 20 points for a
character? They can move through woods already for free if they are
alone!

A. Units can only be joined by characters with the same Blessed
Spawning. So if the Characters during game wanted to join a unit with
Blessed Spawning of Huanchi he would have to be blessed the same way.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. If a character has Charm of the Jaguar Warrior (so, on foot) and

SLANN MAGE-PRIESTS

Q. What if I declare a challenge to a unit with a Slann inside? Can
he take the challenge? What if he refuses?

A. Slann Mage-Priests are not meant for combat, and unless he is in
the fighting rank, he cannot issue or refuse challenges. If he is in
the fighting rank, he can issue and accept challenges as normal.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can a Slann be put in the third or more rank of a unit? The text
mentions the second rank, but not "any" rank.

A. No. Slann can be placed in the front rank, or the second rank.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. How is shooting or casting a spell at a Slann inside a Saurus
unit resolved?  For shooting, do you choose the Slann or the unit, or
do you randomize?  Is the +1 to hit (large target) for the Slann
only, or does it apply also to the unit because the Slann is in it?
As for magic, you could target the Slann (large target) while the
unit is not visible to the caster... does a spell that affect a
"unit" affect the Slann and the Saurus then?

A. As the Slann is a different size from the models around it, it
can be targeted separately. The +1 to hit only applies if shooting at
the Slann. This equally applies for Magic Missiles - and as the Slann
is a Large Target, he might be able to be seen when the unit is not.
If the unit the Slann is with consists of less than 5 models, then
missiles aimed at the unit itself could potentially hit the Slann -
they are randomised as normal.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. Can a Slann use items that are model on foot only?

A. No. He is not a model on foot!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. According to the Warhammer rulebook a Character that isn't placed
in the front rank is effectively out of play and may not use any
magic items, nor may the unit use his leadership. How does this
affect a Slann Mage-Priest placed in the second rank?

A. A Slann Mage-Priest in the second rank is considered to be in the
front rank for all purposes, except that it does not participate in
combat (including issuing / accepting challenges) and it does not
count as being in combat for purposes of its own spell casting and
use of magic items.

*****

Q. Can a 2nd generation Slann cast a spell without using a dice from
the dice pool and just use the "free" dice?

A. No. The dice is extra "after the dice have been rolled" indicating
that the number of dice used to cast the spell initially cannot be 0.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. What is the correct way to handle the Second Generation
Slann's "Free Dice"?  Can he always use it, or only if a spell is
successfully cast (i.e. the casting value is reached), first?

A. It can always be used.  Change the first sentence of the second
paragraph under 'Second Generation' on page 49 to: "Every spell
attempted by the Slann...."

*****

Q. If you have 2 Slann Mage-Priests in your army, but only 1 Temple
Guard unit, must both of the Slann Mage-Priests be placed in the
lone Temple Guard unit?

A. No. If multiple Slann Mage-Priests are included in a Lizardmen
army that includes only one Temple Guard unit, then only one Slann
Mage-Priest must join the Temple Guard unit. The remaining Slann
Mage-Priests may join other Lizardmen units or be fielded on their
own. If a Lizardmen army includes multiple Slann Mage-Priests and
multiple units of Temple Guard, then one Slann Mage-Priest must be
placed within each Temple Guard unit with any excess Slann
Mage-Priests being allowed to join other Lizardmen units or be
fielded on their own.

Q. How does the Casket of Souls effect a Slann in a unit of Temple

SALAMANDERS

Q. How are Salamander Hunting Packs aligned with the enemy in close
combat? Is the Lizardmen player allowed to move the Salamanders into
contact with the enemy models and push the Skink Handlers to the
rear?

A. Note that Salamander Hunting Packs do NOT have any special rules
which state that the Salamanders push to the front of the fighting
in close combat. Therefore Salamander Hunting Packs follow the same
close combat alignment rules as all other Skirmishing units. This
means that when a Salamander Hunting Pack charges an enemy unit it
must maximize the total number of models it can bring into base to
base contact with the enemy. This will generally result in the Skink
Handlers at the center of the fighting rank and a Salamander in
corner to corner contact with the enemy at each end of the fighting
rank.

When a Salamander Hunting Pack is charged by an enemy unit,
the same principles apply with the exception that the enemy must
move into base to base contact with the closest skirmisher (Note
that a defending unit of Skirmishers must also maximize the models
moved into the combat). If the closest skirmisher is a Salamander, then
three Salamanders can generally be placed in the fighting rank.

Q. Is Salamander Spray a Fire Attack or not? The description is
unclear whether it's fire or acid.

A. The special rule is called 'Spout Flame'. Yes, it is flaming!

Q. Do Salamanders need a BS roll to hit or does their ranged attack
hit automatically?

A. They hit automatically, in the same manner as a Ratling Gun and a
Volley Gun.

Q. If I purchase multiple Salamander Hunting Packs as a single Rare
Choice, does each pack operate as a separate unit or do they form
into one large unit?

A. Unlike some prior versions of the Lizardmen army, Salamander
Hunting packs purchased as a single Rare Choice form into one large
unit.  Note that the unit size is indicated as 1-3 Hunting Packs.

Q. When the Salamanders eat Skinks due to Misfire results, does it
force the Salamander Hunting Pack to take a panic test if it causes
25%+ casualties?

A. No test required.

*****

Q. If one Salamander in a unit of three Salamanders loses its three
Skink Handlers, but there are still six Handlers for the other two
Salamanders left in the unit, does that Salamander have to roll on
the Monster Reaction table?

A. No. So long as the unit has at least one Skink Handler still in
it, the Salamanders remain under control. If that last Skink dies,
then the entire unit makes a single Monster Reaction test.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. How do you give victory points for Salamanders pack (reduced to
half size)?

A. This goes by number of models. So if there are 3 Salamanders and
9 Skinks in a unit, the enemy will get half victory points if seven
models are removed (be they Skinks or Salamanders).

Q. Can each Salamander in a pack fire at a different target or
do all of them have to shoot at the same target?

A. They all must shoot at the same target, as they are one unit.

Q. Is a Skink Hero mounted on a Horned One considered to
be a Fast Cavalry Model (i.e. can it march and shoot, move
after a successful feigned flight, etc.)?

A. Yes.  The Horned Ones ridden by Skink Heroes specifically
states that they are Fast Cavalry.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS

Q. With Lord Kroak's Ceremonial Mace of Malachite, magical weapons
count only as hand weapons. What about magic weapons that are not
hand weapons, like Lance of the Quest and Crimson Death, do they also
count as hand weapons?

A. "Magical weapons counts as hand weapons". So, they count only as
hand weapons.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Do you get the benefit for +1 Strength with Kroq-Gar's Revered
Spear of Tlanxla if he charges on foot (if Grymloq is slain)?

A. All the effects of the magic weapon is from it being magical. So
yes.

Q. May a Beasts of Chaos character with the Mark of Khorne,
Nurgle, Tzeentch, or Slaanesh ride in a Tuskgor Chariot?

*****

Q. When exactly do Ambushing units move onto the table?

A. During the Remaining Moves step of the Movement phase the turn
the brayhorn is sounded.  Note that the Beasts of Chaos player sounds
the brayhorn, marks his intended entry points, and takes the Ambush
leadership tests before the Rally Fleeing Troops step of the
Movement phase.

*****

Q. With the Unliving Idol gift (Beasts of Chaos, page 62), the
Daemon counts as a Beast General when choosing the army. Does it
mean that you can have in that case a Shaggoth in this army?

A. Oh, sneaky! Still, the answer is no. It was our intention that
a general who is a Daemon would not have Shaggoths in the same
army (even if the Daemon counted as a Beast for army selection).

BEAST HERDS

Q. If you inflict enough wounds in hand-to-hand to a Beast Herd to
kill all the Gors (including the command), what happens? Can you
"save" the command by allocating two wounds to Ungors? If not, are
the standard and instrument lost or can Ungors pick them up?

A. You cannot choose to remove Ungors instead. If the Gor command
are slain, the Ungors cannot pick up the standard or instrument.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. When lapping around the enemy with Beast Herds, will Gors
normally push past the Ungors to get to the enemy and thus be
the first models "lapping" around?

A. No.  According to the rules for Beastmen Herds the herd
adjusts it's formation when intially charged or charging.
It is silent as to the topic of lapping around, therefore the
main rules take precendence and Ungors in the 'rear' ranks
will normally lap around first.
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book page 19 / Rulebook page 77

*****

Q. What is the proper procedure for allocating / removing casualties
in close combat from Beast Herds containing both Gors and Ungors?

A. If your unit only touches Gors at the start of the combat, the
models with the highest Initiative value's attacks can only score
wounds on Gors. This round of attacks can rack up no more wounds
than the number of Gors, not counting additional wounds from other
circumstances (overkill, etc.).

Any killed Gor models in the front rank would be replaced, by Gors
if available, otherwise by Ungors.

The models with the next highest Initiative value's attacks would
then proceed, and those attacking models touching more than one
type of model have to say what they're attacking against. Again,
attacks against Gors can score no more wounds than the number
of Gors.  Also, attacks against Ungors can score no more wounds
than the number of Ungors.

At the Gor's Initiative value in the sequence, the survivors of
the original front row (if any) can fight against their attackers.
The Ungors would not get to strike in this round of close combat,
unless they had models able to strike at the start of the combat
round (with spears for instance) that were not killed.
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book page 19 / Rulebook page 68

*****

Q. If a Beast Herd is hit by a template, how do you allocate the
wounds? Are the models under the template the only ones that can be
hit? Or can you allocate the wounds affecting Gors under the
template to Ungors out of the template?

A. The template only kills the types of models touched, so the
wounds are not transferred onto Ungors in this case.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If an Unruly unit (i.e. a Beast Herd) declares a charge vs. a
fear causing unit and fails the required fear check (thus not moving)
does a subsequent Unruly result (i.e. a roll of "1" at the start
of the compulsory movement phase) give the Unruly unit another
chance to charge the fear causing unit? Or does the original
failed fear test take precedence?

A. Units failing an Unruly test must charge "if there is an
enemy unit that can be charged using the normal rules". When a
unit fails a fear test when wishing to charge, the main rulebook
indicates that the unit "may not charge or shoot and must remain
stationary in that Movement phase". As they are disallowed from
charging or moving per the 'normal rules', the original failed fear
test takes precedence.  Basically, Unruly is a drawback, and so it
would seem odd if they could charge because of it, when normally
they would not be able to.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Beasts of Chaos Army
Book page 18 / Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. Should a player roll for Unruly units (i.e. Beast Herds) if they
have just rallied that turn?

A. No. The Unruly rules indicate "if there is an enemy unit
that can be charged using the normal rules".  When a unit rallies
it is unable to move that turn, and thus is not eligible to declare
a charge.  Basically, Unruly is a drawback, and so it would seem
odd if they could charge because of it, when normally they would
not be able to. I'd rather not have a situation when a player wants
to be Unruly.

Book page 18 / Rulebook page 45

*****

Q. How does a chariot’s impact hits work against a Beast herd? Are
causalties removed like shooting (so, removing Ungors first?)

A.Casualties are caused against models in base contact first – so
Gors will normally be struck by the chariot first. Any further hits
are randomised.

TROPHIES OF THE BEASTS

Q. How many Beasts characters are able to wear Chaos Armour in
an army?

A. One. 'Chaos Armour' is a magic item in the Beasts of Chaos
book.  Per the magic items section of the main rulebook,
"No specific magic item can be carried by more than one model
in the army, with the exception of scrolls."
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book page 63 / Rulebook page 152

*****

Q. Can Great Bray-Shamans or Bray-Shamans wear magic armour?

A. Generally no as characters without the option to wear mundane
armour may not wear magical armour, however there is one exception.
The magic item 'Chaos Armour' in the Beasts of Chaos book states
"May be given to a Bray-Shaman".  Note that the magic item
also states that "A model may wear Chaos Armour and still cast
spells."
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book pages 52,53,63

*****

Q. Can mortal characters wear the Trollhide armour or are
they "stuck" wearing Chaos armour?

A. Mortal characters may drop their Chaos armour to wear the
Trollhide armour.  The Beasts of Chaos book indicates that
mortals may use any magic items not specifically barred in the
item's description.
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book page 62

*****

Q. The Staff of Darkoth is an Arcane magic item which holds a spell and
"counts as a Braystaff" in close combat.  The text does not explicitly
state that the attacks "count as magical", hence there is confusion
over whether or not attacks from the Staff of Darkoth "count
as magical".  Can you please clarify this for us?

A. I would say that the attacks count as magical.

CHAOS MAGIC

Q. When an enemy unit is affected by Green Fire of Tzeentch and
strike themselves, does the unit use its main weapon (caster
basically chooses), or does the owner of the unit get to choose?
For example, if a unit is equipped with great weapons and shields,
would they use the great weapons (caster's choice) or hand weapon
and shield (owners choice)?

A. Caster’s choice.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118

*****

Q. If casting the Tzeentch spell Green Fire on a unit of swordsmen can
the caster freely choose what equipment the combat is fought with? To
specify can it be cast on a unit of Empire swordsmen that then elect
to only use their hand weapons not using the shields?

A. The caster chooses which weapon to attack with. The Swordsmen will
defend themselves as best they can though, so they would use their
shields. However, if a unit was armed with halberd and shield, the
caster may choose for them to attack with the halberd, so they could
not use their shields to defend with, as they are using a two-handed
weapon.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. How does the spell Green Fire of Tzeentch work against a Beast
Herd?

A. In a mixed unit, the models will hit other models of the same
type. So, the Gors will all hit other Gors, and Ungors will all
hit other Ungors.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Do spells from the Lore of Tzeentch (which are all named as a
different color of fire) count as 'Fire' attacks?

A. No they do not.  None of the Tzeentch spells include the
wording "This is a Fire attack and causes double damage against
flammable targets" as pure flaming spells do. This was confirmed
via the High Elf Q&A for Dragon Armour which states that models
with Dragon Armour are NOT immune to Tzeentch spells.
S. Beasts of Chaos Army Book page 78 / Warhammer Chronicles
2004 page 117 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. If the Tzeentch spell Indigo Fire is cast upon a unit of
skirmishers, where are Horrors placed? It is normally in contact
with the front rank, but skirmishers obviously do not have a
front rank.

A. They are placed against the skirmishing model closest to
the caster.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the

*****

Q. The Titillating Delusions spell. May an affected unit still
declare charges against units in LOS but not on the line designed
by the spell? What about frenzied units who are forced to declare
charges when possible? If a unit is affected, is it considered
"immune to psychology", or can psychology effects alter their
movement? Can you choose to flee from a charge, away from the
direction nominated by the spell? If you cast a magical movement
spell or incantation at an affected unit, can you freely choose
the direction or are you forced to move the unit in the direction
given by the Delusions spell?

A. The thing affected by the spell is the unit's voluntary movements:
all voluntary movement, including those that result from a spell or
incantation, even charge declarations, have to be made in the
direction given by the delusions spell. This includes the voluntary
direction that Spawn and Pump Wagons move in. However, the affected
unit is not Immune to Psychology, and all compulsory movement still
obeys its own rules (compulsory charges, failed terror tests, etc.).
The unit can still flee a charge, but will still be affected by the
spell as soon as it regains its freedom of movement.

Q. The Bretonnian Battle Standard Bearer, carrying the Standard
of the Lady of the Lake (nullifies rank bonus), is slain during
a combat round. Since rank bonus is calculated at the beginning
of the combat round, when the banner was still active, does the
banner’s effect still kick in?

A. Although ranks are determined at the start of the combat
round, the effect of the Standard is only calculated at the
end - if the Standard Bearer is slain, the enemy still
physically had ranks at the start of turn, so they gain
their normal rank bonus.

Q. The Knight’s Vow says that the unit is immune to panic caused by

using their ground movement as skirmishers except that their movement
is halved when moving through difficult terrain. Note this only

GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q. Will the Storm of Chaos army lists be official even after the
campaign is over?

A. Yes.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

*****

Q. In some cases, the variant army lists have selection restrictions
that differ from those in the regular army lists, e.g., there's no
0-1 restriction for a troop type in a variant army list, while there
is one in the regular army list. Should the restriction default to
the one in the original army book? For example, should Knights of
the Realm be a 1+ in an Errantry list? Should White Wolves be a 0-1
choice? Should Von Carstein Vampire Lords be 0-1?

A. If no selection restrictions appear in the variant army list,
there are no restrictions on that unit type in the variant list.
So, Knights of the Realm are not a 1+ choice. Multiple units of White
Wolves ARE allowed in a Middenheim army list, and Von Carstein
Vampire Lords are NOT 0-1 (it's a bad idea to fight in Sylvania). Any
exceptions to this are noted in the relevant army sections in the
Q&As below.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

*****

Q. Some units in Army books have notes that allow two units to be
chosen as a single unit choice. For example, two High Elf Bolt
Throwers may be taken as a single Rare choice in a normal High Elf
army. Do these two-for-one deals apply in the Storm of Chaos lists?
They generally are not marked as such.

A. Players should refer to the Army book unit entries for everything
but selection restrictions (as noted above). In this case that means
that if they are allowed more than one unit as a single choice in the
standard Army book list, then they are allowed more than one unit for
a single choice in the variant list as well. Thus, for instance, two
Bolt Throwers in a Sea Patrol list may be chosen as a single Rare
choice; two Spear Chukkas are a single Special choice in Grimgor's
`Ard Boyz: and two Chaos Spawn are a single Rare choice in Archaon's
Horde.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

Q. If a unit included in a standard army list has special rules, does
that same unit type in a variant army list have those same special
rules, even if those special rules are not specifically listed in
the variant army list? For instance, are Slayers in the Slayer army
still Relentless?

A. Yes, unless stated otherwise, the relevant special rules in Army
books are always used. Thus, Dwarf Slayers in a Slayer army ARE
Relentless, Unbreakable, etc., even though they are not noted as
such in the Slayer army list.

Q. Can new units, magic items, skills, and the like that appear in

HELLCANNON OF CHAOS

Q. In a regular Mortal Chaos army, the Hellcannon can be taken as a

Q. Can the Hellcannon fire normally if it moved? Can it Spew Ichor

Liche Priests will be affected, but Warrior Priests and Tomb Kings
will not.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

*****

Q. How are Victory Points worked out for the Hellcannon?

A. The Hellcannon is a war machine. However, for such an expensive
model that can continue to cause damage after its crew has been
destroyed (albeit sometimes to its own side), we decided that Victory
Points should be awarded in a slightly different way than normal.
If all the crewmen are destroyed, the enemy gets half the Victory
Points for the unit. If the Hellcannon itself is destroyed, then the
enemy gets the full Victory Points for the unit, even if the crewmen
are still alive.

S. Phil Kelly - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. On Page 17 under Rampage it states "When the Hellcannon is
rampaging OR IN COMBAT it may only Spew Ichor in the Shooting phase."
Later under Spew Ichor it states "Instead of firing normally, the
Hellcannon can opt to spew out a great gout of body parts and
daemonic ichor." This seems to suggest that it can only spew ichor if
normally allowed to shoot (i.e. not in close combat). Is the
Hellcannon truly allowed to Spew Ichor when it is engaged in close
combat?

A. The Hellcannon IS ALLOWED to Spew Ichor if it is engaged in
close combat.
S. Phil Kelly - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. As the Hellcannon is classified as a Large Target, if there is a
friendly unit between it and an enemy unit (blocking the Hellcannon
crew's line of sight to the potential target) may the Hellcannon
still fire or must the crew be able to see the potential target?

A. The Hellcannon rules specify that it fires in exactly the
same manner as a stone thrower with the only exceptions listed
related to special affects of the hit. The stone thrower rules in the
main rulebook specify that they do not need to see their specific
target, but they MUST see that there are enemy in the direction they
are firing. This is confirmed in the 2002 Annual War Machines article.
Therefore, if the LoS of the crew to enemy units is completely
blocked by a friendly unit, then the Hellcannon may not fire.

*****

Q. What happens when a Daemon with the Diabolic Splendour gift casts
Yellow Fire of Transformation? Does Yellow Fire of Transformation
still effect the whole unit? Does the Daemon generate a 3+ ward
save?

A. Yellow Fire of Transformation has been rewritten for the
Daemonic Legions as a way to cast Diabolic Splendour as a spell as
noted in the Q&A (printed in White Dwarf) above.

Diabolic Splendour only affects the Daemonic character to whom the
gift has been given (Storm of Chaos page 27). Hence Yellow Fire,
when successfully cast, will only affect the Daemonic caster.

Also note that the effect of multiples of the same gift is not
cumulative (Storm of Chaos page 27). Since Yellow Fire is
effectively Diabolic Splendour as a spell, if the Daemonic character
has Diabolic Splendour gift already, casting Yellow Fire
will not increase his ward save past 4+.

This also means that the Blasted Standard, when carried by a
Daemonic Herald, will only affect the Herald and will have no effect
on the unit he is attached to. Note that the Unholy Icon which gives
the unit carrying it a 4+ ward save is not the Blasted Standard and
rules for the Unholy Icon do not affect the way that the Blasted
Standard works.

Q. If you give a Daemonic Herald the Mark of Khorne, he gains a 6+
armour save. If you also give him the Armour of Khorne, does he get
a 4+ save or is it cumulative (so that he gets a 3+ save)?

A. The effects are not cumulative. Thus, a Herald with the Mark of
Khorne and the Armour of Khorne will have a 4+ armour save.

*****

Q. The way that the new Daemonic mounted units are presented
represents a combined profile of the rider and the steed. Are they
treated as cavalry in other respects?

A. Yes. For spells and the like, Daemonic mounted models are
treated as normal cavalry and they are also subject to Killing Blow.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

*****

Q. Being cavalry, do the new Daemonic mounted units get +1 to their
armour save for being mounted?

A. Mounted Daemonettes, Changebringers, Plagueriders, Pleasureseekers,
and Bloodcrushers are all cavalry and thus gain +1 to their Armour
Save. Note that this is already included in the Bloodcrushers' 5+
Armour save.

Q. The rules state that the Hunt Master cannot be singled out by
missile fire, yet isn't he quite bigger (a man on a horse) than the
rest of the unit (hounds)?

A. The Hunt Master cannot be singled out, as he is regarded as the
same size (i.e. on a cavalry base) as the hounds.

GRIMGOR'S 'ARDBOYZ

Q. Can every Orc unit be Big 'Uns, or should there be at least the
same number of common Orcs as in the O&G army list?

A. You can have as many Big `Uns in the army as you want without the
need to have the same number of "normal" Orcs. Thus, if you wanted,
you could have an entire army of Big `Uns!

Q. The Master Rune of Grimnir mentions deflecting arrows and
cannonballs and states "Any friendly unit within 12" of the standard

"ranged attack" mean in regards to this item? Does it only protect
against shooting, or does it protect against magic as well?

attacks, not magic missiles and other spells. The Slayers have the
Wards of Grimnir and additional dispel dice to protect them against
magic.

Q. If we go strictly on the rules, a fanatic cannot be attacked in
close combat and thus, it appears a Doomseeker can not harm a
fanatic. Is that how we are to play it?

A. You are correct - simply apply their existing rules.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. As Doomseekers do not attack normally, if you are an enemy model
in a ranked unit the maximum amount of hits you can take from
attacking Doomseekers is one, correct?

A. This is correct. Regardless of the number of Doomseekers
attacking a ranked unit, any model in that ranked unit may only
take one hit.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

Q. If you are an enemy model in a ranked unit and two Doomseekers
are in base to base contact with you, you still only take one
automatic hit, correct?

A. This is also correct.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. How exactly are Rank and File model casualties caused by
Doomseeker attacks removed? Do we remove casualties as we would in a
standard combat, or are the Doomseeker attacks considered to be
"allocated" attacks?

A. The Doomseeker attacks are considered to be allocated attacks. As
stated in the Whirlwind of Death rules, the Doomseekers do not attack
normally in close combat. Thus, when resolving a Doomseeker's
attacks against Rank and File models (rolls to wound, armour saves,
etc.), it is very important to segregate hits against the rank and
file models which will have an opportunity to strike back at the
Doomseeker if they survive (e.g. models in base to base (or corner to
corner) contact, models armed with spears, etc.) from those that do
not have an opportunity to strike back at the Doomseeker. Obviously
it is also important to separately resolve hits against characters
and champions.

Q. If two Doomseekers are in base to base contact with a single
enemy model (e.g. a chariot) how many hits does the single enemy

*****

Q. When a Doomseeker scores hits against a single model with multiple
parts (e.g. a character riding on a monstrous mount or chariot) does
the Doomseeker get to choose which part of the enemy model is hit?
Or is it randomized as shooting?

A. As the Doomseeker does not attack normally, it should be randomly
allocated as shooting.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Does a Doomseeker get re-rolls to hit Greenskins in the first
round of combat due to hatred? Does a Doomseeker need sixes to hit an
enemy unit behind a defended obstacle?

A. No. He does not attack (or roll to hit) in the normal manner and
therefore, the re-rolls to hit do not apply. In addition special
rules or magic items which modify a "to hit" roll do not apply to a
Doomseeker.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

Q. How do we resolve a situation where a Doomseeker is engaged with
a Skaven model (or models) armed with Plague Censers?

A. The Doomseeker strikes first, as he strikes before all types
of other special attacks. Note however, that the Doomseeker is still
required to pass a Toughness test (or lose a wound) as the test is
required of all models in base to base contact with a Plague Censer
at the beginning of the close combat phase.

Leadership of 8 and a 5+ Daemonic Aura rather than a true Ward Save.

Q. If a unit of Cold One Knights has the Soul Shadows Standard,

Anointed be equipped with a Chaos Daemon Sword?

A. Yes. Both are allowed to take Hordes of Chaos magic items tagged
as "Models with Mark of Slaanesh Only" per the army list. The Chaos
Daemon Sword is tagged as "Models with a Mark of Chaos Only"
as the item's effects change based on the patron god. The item meets
the "Models with a Mark of Slaanesh Only" intent as in this case,
the sword grants the bearer the same WS, S, I, and A of a Keeper of

Q. Does the Righteous Fury special rule for Empire Warrior Priests
of Sigmar, which states that the Warrior Priests and the unit they
are with hate all models in ALL Chaos armies, apply against the Cult
of Slaanesh army?

A. Yes. The name of the army alone gives us the answer, as the
army is clearly affiliated with Chaos. Upon the sight of daemons
and/or the symbols of Chaos, the Warrior Priests will whip their
units into a righteous fury. Warrior Priests of Sigmar
and the unit they are with hate all models in a Cult of Slaanesh

Q. Are High Elves immune to panic when fighting against a Cult of

A. Yes. As all Cult of Slaanesh armies are led by a Dark Elf and
include Dark Elf units, High Elves are immune to panic when fighting
against a Cult of Slaanesh army. The blood fued between the Asur
and the Druchii is rooted in the original founding of the Cult of
Slaanesh by Morathi and finding chaos followers of Slaanesh
accompanying a Dark Elf army would neither surprise or weaken the
resolve of the Asur.

and the exemption from the Intrigue at Court rule?

A. The Master of the Mists Honour and the exemption from Intrigue at
Court applies to all Sea Lords. The name of the Sea Lord at the time
of the Storm of Chaos campaign happens to be Aislinn. Also note that
Aislinn is not considered to be a "special character".

A. Yes.

*****

Q. If during deployment, I attach a mounted character (e.g. a Sea
Lord on a Dragon) to a unit of Sea Guard, may he also fire during
the Master of the Mists special round of shooting?

A. No. The intent was that only characters on foot attached to a
unit of Sea Guard or Sea Rangers would benefit from the special
round of shooting.

Q. Can a Sea Lord (or Commodore) with the Radiant Gem of Hoeth or
Loremaster Honour act as a mage for purposes of the Summoned from

Q. A Merwyrm must take an immediate Leadership test, using the
leadership of the mage who has bound it, if it fails a Regeneration
roll. If there is no regeneration roll (i.e. the Merwyrm
has been wounded by a flaming attack), what happens?

A. A Leadership test is taken if the Merwyrm fails a Regeneration
roll. If there is no Regeneration test, then it cannot be failed –
thus the Merwyrm does not need to test.
S. October 2004 Issue of White Dwarf Magazine (US #297 / UK #298)

*****

Q. A Merwyrm must take an immediate Leadership test, using the
leadership of the mage who has bound it, if it fails a Regeneration
roll. If it fails this test, it must then roll on the Monster
reaction table (treating a result of 5-6 as the creature acting dumb
instead of guarding a fallen rider). If the test is failed and a
Monster reaction applied to the Merwyrm does the reaction apply for
the remainder of the game?

A. No. If the test is failed, apply the Monster reaction on the
owning player's next turn - after which the mage is considered to
have regained control of the Merwyrm (unless it has failed a
subsequent Regeneration roll and Leadership test).
S. Storm of Chaos Book page 94 / Andy Hoare - Warhammer Design Team.

*****

Q. If the mage who has bound the Merwyrm has been slain, does the
Merwyrm still have to take Leadership tests for failed Regeneration
rolls?

A. No, if the mage has been slain, then the Merwyrm no longer has to
take such Leadership tests. Note however that the Merwyrm will have
to take a Leadership test (on its own leadership) at the start of
the owning player's turn and that if this test is failed the
subsequent Monster Reaction result will apply for the remainder
of the game.

Q. When will the final Ogre Kingdoms Q&As from the Studio be released?

A. Unfortunately, due to circumstances outside of my control, the final

*****

Q. When a Butcher reads a dispel scroll, does it automatically dispel 
all of the Gut Magic spells he has in play?

A. No.  After further thought and discussion, I have reversed the
ruling originally issued in the "Sneak Peak" FAQ on the GW Warhammer Forum.
S. Phil Kelly - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Can a Tyrant, Bruiser, or Hunter equipped with heavy or light armour 
(note all three characters come with light armour as standard equipment) also 
wear the Bullgut or Gut Maw?  Or does selecting the Bullgut or Gut Maw replace 
their mundane body armour (and leave them with only a 6+ armour save)?

A. They may be equipped with the Bullgut or Gut Maw in addition to their
mundane body armour.  For example, a Tyrant equipped with Heavy Armour and 
the Gut Maw has a 4+ armour save.

Q. Where the rules released in White Dwarf for the Rhinox Cavalry 
suppose to be given the "Official" tag or are these "Organizer 
Discretion" (as per Gav's previous comments in regards to the Arch 
Lector of Sigmar) in regards to tournaments? 

A. As with all rules published in White Dwarf, if you want to use them 
at a tournament you should check with the tournament organiser first.

Kingdoms FAQ found on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum at:

BRUISER

Q. What is the correct BS for a Bruiser? The Bestiary on page 23 indicates
that he has a BS of 4, while his entry in the army list on page 69 and in 
the summary on page 80 indicate that he has a BS of 3.

A. The Bruiser has a BS of 3 – Bruisers are much better at hitting things 
with their fists than with complex weaponry.

*****

HUNTER

Q. Is it correct that as the rules for the Harpoon Launcher do not 
include the term “Move-or-Fire”, the Hunter is allowed to move and shoot 
with it?

A. No, the Hunter may not move and fire with his Harpoon Launcher – he 
must take time to reload it just as if it were a crossbow.

*****

Q. Does the phrase “fired exactly like a bolt thrower” mean that armour
saves are not allowed for hits from a Harpoon Launcher and each model 
wounded by it sustains D3 wounds? Does it mean that a Hunter is allowed 
to pivot on the spot, without penalty, prior to firing a Harpoon Launcher?

A. Yes in all cases. The Harpoon Launcher allows no armour saves, 
inflicts D3 wounds, and the Hunter may pivot before firing provided he 
is not accompanied by Sabretusks. 

*****

Q. Why does the Hunter have “Bull Charge” listed as a special rule in his 
profile on page 69 of the army list and in the summary on page 80? If he 
charges at a target alongside both of his Sabretusks, does he cause an 
impact hit?

A. This is simply for completeness, the Hunter is an Ogre and therefore 
could Bull Charge if he weren’t such a loner! He does not cause impact hits 
even when he is with two ‘tusks.

*****

Q. May Sabretusks be released by a Hunter during the Remaining Moves phase? 
Or must they accompany the Hunter until he releases them for a charge?

A. They must accompany him until he releases them for a charge or when they
are released to pursue a fleeing unit.

*****

OGRE BULLS

Q. When a unit of Ogre Bulls is equipped with hand weapons and Ironfists, 
do they lose, or retain their Ogre Clubs?

A. They retain them, though their abilities do not ‘stack’ – if Ironfists 
are used in any way the Ogre Club special rule is discounted and they 
are counted as hand weapons.

*****

Q. The description for Ironfists states that you may choose to use them as 
either a shield or an additional hand weapon at the start of each combat. 
May Ironfists also be used as a shield against ranged attacks?

A. No, they may not.

*****

LEADBELCHERS

Q. If a Leadbelcher cannon misfire results in a unit of Leadbelchers 
losing 25% or more of the unit as casualties, does the unit have to take 
a panic test?

A. No, they do not; panic tests for losing 25% of the unit are only 
incurred from enemy fire (see page 80 of the Warhammer Rulebook). 

*****

YHETEES

Q. As Yhetees carry an Ice Weapon in each hand, do they receive +1 attack 
for being equipped with an additional hand weapon?

A. No, they do not (not all Yhetee models have two weapons). 

*****

Q. Does the Aura of Frost affect friendly models that the Yhetee may be 
in base to base contact with (e.g. during a combat involving multiple units)?

A. Yes, the Aura of Frost affects friendly models, but not other Yhetees. 

*****

MANEATERS

Q. In cases where a Maneater unit includes models with a mix of weapons, 
is each Maneater allowed to utilize a different weapon from that of other 
Maneaters in the unit in close combat? 

A. Yes.

*****

Q. Assuming yes, this may result in Maneaters with different Weapon Skill 
and Initiative values in the unit. Are we to treat all Maneaters as 
champions in the respect that attacks must be specifically allocated at 
them in close combat and wounds suffered in close combat do not carry over 
onto other models in the unit (i.e. wounds are tracked separately for each 
Maneater)? Are we to track wounds from shooting and magic separately for 
each model or does the owning player still have to remove whole models when 
possible?

A. No, wounds are transferred as if they were a normal unit of models 
with multiple wounds and it is up to the owning player which Maneater is 
removed first. Wounds cannot be spread amongst the unit. For instance, if 
a unit of Maneaters suffers three wounds from a unit of charging Empire 
Knights; the owning player might choose to remove a Maneater with a brace 
of handguns and leave the Ogre with a Great Weapon as he is better equipped 
to deal with cavalry.

*****

SCRAPLAUNCHER

Q. The timing of the measurement to ascertain if a Bad Tempered test is 
required is not specified. Is this measurement made before, or after 
normal charges are declared?

A. After normal charges. 

*****

Q. The Gnoblar Scraplauncher does not have the Largely Insignificant rule, 
was this an oversight or intentional?

A. This is intentional. 

*****

Q. Is a Gnoblar Scraplauncher counted as “Greenskinned” for purposes of 
hatred, etc.?

A. Yes it is.

*****

GUT MAGIC

Q. When a Butcher first attempts to cast the Bonecruncher, Toothcracker, 
or Trollguts spell, does he still suffer the negative effects (hits/wounds) 
if the spell is successfully dispelled by the enemy?

A. No. 

*****

Q. The Gut Magic rules state that if a Gut Magic spell has already 
been successfully cast that phase and a second Butcher wishes to cast the 
same spell, the casting level is doubled. What exactly does “successfully 
cast” mean in this context? Does it count as “successfully cast” if the 
casting value is simply met? Or does it only count as “successfully cast” 
if the spell was not dispelled?

A. It only counts as “successfully cast” if the casting value was met and 
the spell was not dispelled.

*****

Q. If a Butcher is killed, are all the Gut Magic spells he has in 
play removed?

A. Yes. 

*****

Q. The Gut Magic rules state that each Ogre unit may only have one 
Gut Magic spell in play upon it at one time. May a Butcher voluntarily 
end a Gut Magic spell in play? Or may a Butcher cast a new spell upon an 
Ogre unit with an existing Gut Magic spell in play, as a replacement?

A. The latter - a Butcher must cast a new spell upon an Ogre unit with an 
existing Gut Magic spell in play to replace it.

*****

Q. What happens if a lone character with a Gut Magic spell in play upon
him joins a unit of Ogres without any Gut Magic spell in play upon them? 
Does the character continue to benefit from the spell? Does the entire 
unit now benefit from the Gut Magic spell as well? 

A. The character alone will benefit – if another Gut Magic spell is 
subsequently cast upon that unit it will replace the current spell effect
that the character is under.

*****

Q. If a lone character has a Gut Magic spell in play upon him 
(e.g. Toothcracker) is he allowed to join a unit of Ogres with a different
Gut Magic spell in play upon them (e.g. Trollguts)? If yes, what happens?

A. No, as he becomes part of that unit and a unit may only have one Gut 
Magic spell in play at any one time. In the case mentioned above the 
character would lose the effects of his spell and gain the effects of 
the spell affecting the unit he has joined.

*****

Q. What happens if a character attached to a unit with a Gut Magic spell
in play upon it leaves the unit? Does the character continue to benefit 
from the spell? If yes, does the unit continue to benefit from the spell 
as well? 

A. The character no longer benefits from the spell, as it was cast on 
the unit and he is no longer part of that unit.

*****

Q. The Gut Magic rules state that an opponent may dispel any Gut Magic 
spell in his “own” magic phase as though it was a Remains in Play spell 
cast with a Power level of 7. Can an opponent also use excess dispel 
dice to attempt to dispel Gut Magic spells in play at the end of the 
Ogre Kingdoms player’s subsequent magic phases? If yes, do we also treat
the Gut Magic spells in play as Remains in Play spells cast with a 
Power level of 7?

A. Yes and yes, though the spells may only be dispelled in this way if 
they were cast in an earlier magic phase.

*****

Q. It is stated in the rules for Tooth-Gnoblars that sacrificing one 
adds +1 to the “casting value” of a spell. Should this actually say that
you add +1 to the total of the power dice rolled? 

A. Quite correct, it adds one to the total of the power dice. 

*****

Q. Do magic items (or abilities) which destroy spells affect Gut Magic
spells? If yes, is the spell considered destroyed for all the Butchers
on the table, or just forgotten by the Butcher who attempted to cast the spell?

A. Yes, they affect Gut Magic spells – though they would only affect the 
Butcher targeted by that effect. So, for instance, a Rune of Spelleating
could destroy a Butcher’s Trollguts spell, but other Butchers would still
know that spell. 

*****

Q. Does the "Fire" rule apply to units affected by spells that grant 
regeneration (e.g. Trollguts)? If the unit is harmed by a flaming attack
while the spell is in play upon it, is the spell’s regeneration affect 
negated?

A. Yes, it would negate that Regeneration ability. 

*****

Q. Also, if a unit was harmed by a flaming attack early in the game, 
may a spell with regenerative powers be cast on the unit in a later turn 
and grant them Regeneration? Or does the fact that they were harmed by a 
flaming attack prevent them from ever benefiting from the regenerative 
powers of the spell? 

A. No, they may later benefit from Regeneration as they are not a 
Regenerating creature at the time of the flaming attack.

*****

MAGIC ITEMS

Q. Was the omission of the Enchanted Shield from the list of Common 
Magic Items available to an Ogre Kingdoms army intentional? 

A. Yes.

*****

Q. Is the Thundermace a "Tyrant Only" magic weapon? 

A. No. 

*****

Q. In regards to the Thundermace, does the phrase “exactly as if the 
unit had suffered a direct hit by a Strength 4(8) stone thrower” mean 
that enemy models that are hit are not allowed armour saves and sustain 
D6 wounds each? Also, per the main rulebook if a shot from a stone 
thrower lands into a combat and touches models from either side that 
are fighting, then the players are to work out the number of hits as normal
but equally distribute them to both sides. Thus, are hits using the stone 
thrower template from the Thundermace distributed to both sides in the 
fighting, or are only the enemy models under the template affected? 

A. As it says in the item’s description, friendly models are not affected.
All enemy models under the template are potential hits, the number of hits
is not distributed amongst the combatants as with a stone thrower hitting
a close combat. Enemy models may not take armour saves and take D6 wounds each. 

*****

Q. Does Siegebreaker hit chariots automatically, as the chariot itself 
does not have an Initiative characteristic? Or do you resolve the attack 
by comparing the WS of the bearer to the initiative of the crew (or character)
controlling the chariot?

A. Resolve the attack by comparing the wielder’s WS with the highest I 
value of the crew. 

*****

Q. Do the miscast effects of the Greatskull apply against friendly Gut 
Magic spells?

A. No, the entry should read ‘any enemy spellcaster’.

*****

Q. Does the Greedy Fist eat the magical properties of magic close combat
weapons used against the bearer on a successful ward save or just armour 
saves? 

A. Any Saving throw, so this includes Ward Saves. The Greedy Fist’s effects
only work in close combat.

*****

Q. If an enemy Wizard suffers a miscast from the Hellheart and subsequently
rolls a “1” on the Gut Magic Miscast Table, what happens? Does the enemy 
Wizard suffer the fate of the unlucky Butcher described in the table in this
case? Also, do all the other friendly Butchers on the table still take D3 
wounds? Or do other enemy Wizards take the D3 wounds instead?

A. The enemy wizard is destroyed, and all Butchers take D3 wounds. Such are 
the rewards of those who truck with Chaos.

*****

Q. Are wizards that ignore miscasts (e.g. a Fourth Generation Slann) required 
to roll on the Gut Magic Miscast table if they miscast while the Hellheart 
is in play?

A. No, they are immune to its effects.

*****

DOGS OF WAR

Q. If a unit of Ironguts is selected as a Dogs of War unit, may they choose 
a magic standard? If yes, may they select it from the army they are being 
included with? For example, if selected in an Orcs & Goblins army, may they
select the Banner of Butchery? Or, may a unit of Ironguts selected as a 
Dogs of War unit select a banner from the Ogre Kingdoms book? 

A. A single Irongut Dogs of War unit per army may select a magic banner 
from the Ogre Kingdoms or Common magic item lists as described in their entry.

*****

Q. Does the Ogre Bulls entry in the Ogre Kingdoms book replace the Ogres 
entry in the Dogs of War list? If not, may Dogs of War Ogres utilize the 
Bull Charge rule?

A. No and No. Dogs of War players may use either their normal entry or 
those noted as Dogs of War in the Ogres army list.

*****

OTHER 

Q. The Brutish Hordes special rules state under “reminders and clarifications”
that wounds on rank and file Ogres and Ogre champions need to be kept track 
of separately, as wounds are not carried over to one another. Does the phrase
“as wounds are not carried over to one another” also apply to the situation 
where excess wounds are caused on the rank and file Ogres and the excess would
normally be applied to the champion (as he is also still considered a rank 
and file model for this purpose)?

A. No, it does not – wounds are carried over in this case. 

*****

Q. May Chaos Ogres utilize the Bull Charge rule?

A. No.

*****

Q. The rules for Skrag the Slaughterer, state that Skrag MUST be accompanied
by at least 2 Gorgers. Does Skrag form a unit with these two Gorgers (similar
to how a Hunter forms a unit with the Sabretusks)? Do these two Gorgers 
deploy as normal troops and start the game on the tabletop?

A. No, they do not form a unit. They deploy as normal for Gorgers. 

*****

Q. As Greasus Goldtooth and Skrag the Slaughterer are mounted on larger 
bases than 50mm square, the main rules seem to indicate that they may be 
singled out as targets for shooting and magical attacks. Is this correct? 

A. They may be singled out and cannot claim a ‘Look out Sir’ roll.

GENERAL

Q. Can the Treeman and Treeman Ancient perform a Stand & Shoot 
charge reaction with the Strangle-root attack?
   
A. The Direwolf FAQ Council submitted multiple requests to the
Design Team for an answer to this question but unfortunately 
did not receive a response.  The Warhammer Community as a whole is
divided on the answer, and without a response from the Design Team
this question is unable to be satisfactorily resolved. While the
FAQ Council itself leans towards the answer being that Stand & Shoot
is allowed based on our interpretation of existing rules, we do not
believe it strongly enough to make such a ruling at this time.
The Council therefore recommends that you discuss the Strangle-Root 
attack with your opponent or the event organizer prior to its use.

Q. What is the appropriate base size of the Great Stag and 
Unicorn models, 40mm square or 50mm square?
   
A. 50mm square.  This is the size indicated for a Unicorn Mounted 
Character in the Base Size Chart printed in UK White Dwarf and
allows the models to rank up properly with other units of Wood Elf 
Cavalry.

Q. In the Wood Elf Reference sheet (last page of the army book) 
Elven Steeds are listed as having the "Fast Cavalry" rule. If a 
Wood Elf character is mounted on an Elven Steed does he benefit 
from the "Fast Cavalry" rule?
   
A. As it currently stands, no. The Bestiary takes
precedence over the back-of-the-book Reference Sheet and the
Bestiary does NOT list Elven Steeds as "Fast Cavalry". 
S. Wood Elf Army Book pages 30 & 80

*****

Q. Is a Great Eagle a flying skirmisher?

A. No.  A Great Eagle is NOT classified as a "Unit of Flyers", and
is therefore not a skirmisher.  This means that a Great Eagle is
classified as a monster per the "Unit Strength and Single Model's
Movement" chart found in Warhammer Chronicles 2004.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

WARDANCERS
   
Q. May non-Wardancer characters join Wardancer units?
   
A. Yes, there is no longer any limitation restricting 
non-Wardancer characters from joining Wardancer units.
S. Wood Elf Army Book pages 26, 66
   
*****
   
Q. Is a Wardancer unit required to select their Shadow Dance at
the start of a combat?  Or in cases where they are not attacking
first, may they wait until after the enemy attacks before 
selecting a Shadow Dance?
   
A. The Wood Elf book is silent on the timing of when the Wardancers
are required to select their Shadow Dance.  The usual method requires 
a player to declare any equipment options / optional special rules 
affecting the Close Combat at the start of the phase, prior to the 
resolution of any attacks.  The FAQ Council recommends
that the usual method be also followed in this case.
S. Rulebook page 88  /  Wood Elf Army Book page 19

*****

Q. May a Wardancer Kindred Character use a Great Weapon to gain 
+2 to his Strength?

A. No. Per the rules under the Wardancer Kindred, all Wardancer
Characters have the Special Rule of "Wardancer Weapons".  This
means that regardless of what types of mundane weapons the model
is armed with, the model must follow the "Wardancer Weapons" rule.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 19, 66
   
*****
   
SPITES OF ATHEL LOREN
   
Q. If a character from the Wardancer Kindred has A Murder of Spites
are these attacks affected by his abilities which add +1 Strength to
all attacks or Killing Blow?
   
A. No! The Spites have a separate and distinct set of explicitly 
defined stats and abilities and thus they do not benefit from 
any abilities of their host.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 60
   
*****
   
Q. Can a character use A Muster of Malevolents or A Pageant of
Shrikes after marching?
   
A. No.  The Spites "count as a ranged weapon" or are listed as
a "shooting attack". As the rules do not explicitly allow 
for use of these Spites after a march, they may not. 
S. Wood Elves Army Book pages 60, 61 / Rulebook page 55
 
*****
   
Q. If a character has the Muster of Malevolents Spites, may they
always stand and shoot with their own weapon as well as the Spites
regardless of Line of Sight and distance?
   
A. No. The reference to "any other ranged weapon the model may have" 
is making it clear that the model may perform a normal stand and 
shoot with both, NOT that the other ranged weapon is suddenly 
privileged with the Spites' additional stand and shoot 
powers.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 60
   
*****
   
Q. What happens when a character with the Annoyance of Netlings (only 
hit on a six in a challenge) is in a challenge against a character
that always hits on a pre-set number (e.g. a Vampire Counts Wight Lord in 
a unit containing the Banner of the Barrows)?
   
A. This is a case of an "irresistible force" vs. an "immovable
object". In other words, roll a D6 each close combat round to see
whether the enemy hits on a the pre-set number or needs sixes to hit.
S. Rulebook page 43
   
*****
   
HEIRLOOMS OF ATHEL LOREN
   
Q. Can Gaemrathe - the Banner of Midwinter be used in the opponent's 
movement phase?
   
A. The Direwolf FAQ Council submitted multiple requests to the
Design Team for an answer to this question but unfortunately
did not receive a response.  The Council was divided on the answer as 
on one hand the item appears overpriced if it is not allowed to be 
activated in the opponent's turn, but on the other hand the usual 
practice is that an item would have to explicitly state that you could 
activate it prior to the enemy declaring charges in order
for the item to be activated in the enemy's turn.
The Council therefore recommends that you discuss this item with
your opponent or the event organizer prior to its use.

*****
   
Q. Does The Spear of Twilight count as a spear like The Dawnspear?
Specifically does it grant +1S on the charge like a spear?
   
A. The Direwolf FAQ Council submitted multiple requests to the
Design Team for an answer to this question but unfortunately 
did not receive a response.  The Council was divided on the answer 
as on one hand it is described as a "spear" in both the item name and 
in the item's description, but on the other it does not explicitly 
state "Spear." or "Counts as Spear." as it appears it is required 
to per the Magic Item rules in the Warhammer Rulebook.
The Council therefore recommends that you discuss this item with
your opponent or the event organizer prior to its use.

*****
   
Q. Does the Deepwood Sphere affect enemy models engaged in 
hand to hand combat?
   
A. Yes.  The description states: "All enemy models wholly
or partly within the same wood as the bearer take a single
S5 hit at the start of each Wood Elf magic phase."
No exception for enemy models engaged in hand to hand combat 
is given.  In addition, as the affect is not classified as a 
shooting attack or a spell there are no general rules protecting 
enemy models in hand to hand combat from it.

*****
   
Q. Does Asyendi's Bane allow the bearer to re-roll shooting attacks
provided by sources other than the bow (i.e. additional shooting 
attacks provided by Spites, etc.)? 
   
A. No.  Asyendi's Bane is a magical bow that punishes its wielder for 
missed shots made by it. So its effect applies to missed shooting 
rolls using it, but not to other ranged attacks the character may be
able to field. Note that the description of the item does not 
extend the ability past shots fired from the bow.

Q. Do Dragontooth arrows have any affect on units consisting of
single wound models?
   
A. No.  Any single wound model wounded by a Dragontooth arrow
is in fact dead...and dead models don't take Stupidity tests!
Dragontooth arrows only work against models with multiple wounds.

Q. Does the Stone of Rebirth activate if the bearer is wounded by an
attack that does multiple wounds / killing blow that would kill 
the model outright? If yes, is the model considered reduced to
one wound? 
   
A. No. Nowhere in the item's description does it indicate that
the item is activated if the model is killed outright.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 64
   
*****
   
Q. What is the effect of an item like the Armor of Damnation (re-
roll successful hits) on Daith's Reaper (re-roll misses)?
   
A. The attacking player rolls to hit and re-rolls misses. Then
the defending player makes the attacker re-roll all successful 
attacks.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 118
   
*****
   
Q. If you combine "An Annoyance of Netlings" (bearer hit on sixes
in challenge) with the Fimbulwinter Shard (-1 to hit character in
hand-to-hand), does it mean the Character cannot be hit in a
challenge?
   
A. No, a character is always hit on a natural six.
S. Rulebook page 69
   
*****
   
Q. How do you work out close combat attacks from the spirit sword
against units of creatures with multiple Wounds (such as Trolls,
Ogres, or Fellbats)?
   
A. This sword should be treated like a weapon that
inflicts multiple wounds, meaning that each wound may inflict 
wounds up to the maximum for each enemy model. The description of the
Spirit Sword states that "any enemy that suffers one or more unsaved
wounds from the Spirit Sword must roll a d6 and add their
Leadership -- the wielder does the same. For each point the wielder
wins by, his opponent suffers an additional wound, with no Armor
Saves or Ward Saves allowed."
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 62
   
*****
   
Q. Does the secondary damage from the Spirit Sword still take place
if an enemy is wounded and killed by it? Meaning the WE Character
could take damage after killing the opponent or generate overkill in
a challenge.
   
A. Yes, treat as other multi-wound weapons, but instead of rolling 
to multiply wounds, use the will comparison procedure in the Spirit 
Sword description. No exceptions are listed so this means that the 
Wood Elf character could take damage or generate additional overkill 
in a challenge.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 62
   
*****
   
Q. If the Spirit Sword inflicts wounds on multiple opponents (i.e.,
the bearer splits his attacks between two or more models) is an
additional wound test required for each opponent?
   
A.  Yes. There is no reason to believe the ability may be used 
only once per combat phase.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 62
   
*****
   
Q. How does the Spirit Sword work with regeneration? Can wounds
from the LD battle be regenerated? It specifically mentions no
armour or ward saves, but says nothing about regeneration (but
neither does Killing Blow).
   
A. Treat as other multi-wound attacks and regeneration per the Q&A 
in Warhammer Chronicles 2004. That is, perform the will comparison 
procedure to determine the total wounds caused, then at the end of the 
close combat phase (but before combat resolution is counted), attempt
the regeneration for each wound taken (up to the total the model had 
at the start of the combat phase).

MAGIC LORE OF ATHEL LOREN
   
Q. A portion of the Lore of Athel Loren spell "The Hidden Path" reads 
as follows:"If the spell is successful, the unit treats all terrain 
as open ground and cannot be harmed by non-magical missile weapons."
Does this spell allow units to see through terrain, therefore allowing 
them to charge an "unseen" unit or fire missile weapons at a unit behind
interposing terrain? 
   
A. No.  The effects of The Hidden Path do not alter the line of sight 
characteristics of terrain. The reference to "open ground" refers
to the ability to move unimpeded as stated in the Warhammer
Rulebook.  
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 79 / Rulebook page 50
   
*****
   
Q. If a Wood Elf unit targeted with the Call of the Hunt spell can 
not see any enemy units (e.g. they are in a wood) but the additional 
movement brings them in contact with an enemy unit, is this 
considered a charge or are they stopped 1" away?
   
A. It is considered a charge. The visibility of
enemy units is only discussed in regards to the direction the affected
unit must move ("towards the nearest enemy unit it can see"). The
spell states that if the "movement brings the unit into contact with
the enemy, it counts as charging in the subsequent close combat
phase." Ergo, a charge.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 79
   
*****
   
Q. The Call of the Hunt spell states "If already engaged in combat
each model in the unit gains +1 Attack (does not affect steeds
or ridden monsters)".  How long does this additional +1 Attack
last?  For the duration of the next combat round?  For the duration
of the combat?  Or for the duration of the game?
   
A. The usual method used to define spells lasting more than one phase
is to explicitly state in the description that the spell lasts for a
longer duration or Remains in Play. Spells that do not have either 
set of language are generally considered to be immediately resolved 
or resolved in the next applicable phase. The FAQ Council recommends 
that the usual method be also followed  in this case (i.e. the +1 
Attack is only used in the next Round of combat).

Direwolf FAQ council Interpretation
   
*****
   
Q. Can the Call of the Hunt spell move a unit under the effects of
the Banner of Midwinter?
   
A. Yes.  The Warhammer Rulebook indicates that units which are
subject to a magical affect that prohibits movement may be forced
to move by a subsequent spell cast at them.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 79 / Rulebook page 142
   
*****
   
Q. Does the "Fire" rule apply to units affected by spells that grant 
regeneration (e.g. Ariel's Blessing)? If the unit is harmed by a 
flaming attack while the spell is in play upon it, is the spell’s 
regeneration affect negated?
   
A. Yes, it would negate that Regeneration ability. 
S. "Sneak Peak" Ogre Kingdoms FAQ found on the Games Workshop 
Warhammer Forum 
   
*****
   
Q. Also, if a unit was harmed by a flaming attack early in the game, 
may a spell with regenerative powers be cast on the unit in a later turn 
and grant them Regeneration? Or does the fact that they were harmed by a 
flaming attack prevent them from ever benefiting from the regenerative 
powers of the spell? 
   
A. No, they may later benefit from Regeneration as they are not a 
Regenerating creature at the time of the flaming attack.

KINDREDS
   
Q. Can a character with the Wild Rider Kindred take the Helm of the
Hunt?
   
A. No. The description of the Wild Rider Kindred says that they 
"may not choose any additional weapons or armor, though they may 
choose a magic spear or a suit of magical light armor to replace the
respective item if they wish." Since the "Helm of the Hunt" is in the
"magic armor" section, by a strict reading of the text a Wild Rider 
Kindred would not be able to take it.
S. Wood Elf Army Book pages 20, 68
   
*****
   
Q. May a character from the Eternal Kindred take additional
mundane armour or weapons and still benefit from the Eternal Guard
fighting style?
   
A. The character may technically take additional mundane armour and/or
weapons, but he cannot gain any benefit from it.  The special rules 
associated with the fighting style (i.e., 5+ armour save, fights as if 
armed with two hand weapons) clearly state that they apply regardless of 
how the model is armed and armoured.
S. Wood Elf Army Book page 68
   
*****
   
Q. Does either the Eternal Kindred, or Wild Rider Kindred remove a
character's Longbow?
   
A. No. There is no specific provision for removing the longbow 
in either Kindred's description.

Q. Can Regiments of Renown or Dogs of War units be joined by non-Dogs
of War Characters?

A. No.

Q. Can other Warhammer armies hire non-named Dogs of War characters
(i.e. Mercenary General, Hireling Wizard Lord, Paymaster, Mercenary
Captain, Hireling Wizard) as a Rare choice?

A. No, you can't field these types of Dogs of War characters unless
you're a Dogs of War army.
S. Ian Hawkes - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. How are named standard bearers from Regiments of Renown handled
in terms of capturing / losing standards?

A. As named standard bearers from Regiments of Renown are
classified as characters they should be handled as Battle Standard
Bearers in terms of capturing / losing banners.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 68 / Direwolf FAQ Council
Interpretation

*****

Q. When charged by a chariot, do pike attacks go before impact hits?

A. No.  The Warhammer Design Team has specifically stated that
impact hits always happen before everything else in a combat, unless
specifically noted otherwise.  Therefore chariot impact hits qualify
as a being "entitled to strike first because of a special ability"
which per the rules for pikes "will still strike before pike-armed
models."
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Warhammer Chronicles 2004
page 57 / Rulebook page 128

*****

Q. When engaged in close combat with an enemy unit to their front, how
many ranks do pikeman fight in?

A. Provided the unit has enough ranks, four ranks if the unit was
stationary or three ranks if the unit charged that turn as is
outlined in the Fight In Ranks section of the Warhammer Rulebook. Note
that in cases where a pikemen unit consists of three ranks or less,
all the ranks will fight when engaged with an enemy unit to their
front, regardless of whether the unit was stationary or charged that
turn.
S. Rulebook page 89 / Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 57

*****

Q.  In the description for the Paymaster it indicates that he is
treated exactly like a Battle Standard.  Is he therefore a
allowed to carry a magic banner?

A. No.  The reference in the Paymaster's rules directs players to
treat the keys to the pay chest like a Battle Standard.  Note that
nowhere in the Rulebook does it state that a Battle Standard
Bearer is entitled to carry a magic banner.  It is the existing
Sixth Edition army books which explicitly state that Battle Standard
Bearers may carry magic banners. The Paymaster is not explicitly
given the ability to carry a magic banner in the Dogs of War army
list, therefore, he may not.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 57 / Rulebook page 102

*****

Q. Is it legal for a living character, such as a Mercenary Captain,
to join an Undead unit (e.g. The Cursed Company)?

A. The intention of the rules is that no, Undead units cannot be
joined by non-Undead characters and vice versa.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. What is the correct number of attacks for Long Drong's
Slayer Pirates?

A. Since the "Festooned With Pistols" special rule for the
unit states they "gain an additional attack because they are
fighting with a pistol in each hand", you should add 1 to the
Attacks value in the displayed statline. Thus, Long Drong has
3+1=4 Attacks and each Pirate has 1+1=2 Attacks.

17. CHAOS DWARFS RAVENING HORDES LIST

+++++

Q. What is the correct description for Blunderbusses?

A. P.32: Blunderbuss rules.  The last two sentences should be
changed from "Hits are resolved at S3 if firing in 1 rank, S4
if firing in 2 ranks and S5 if in 3 or more ranks. Ranks must
be complete to count." to "Hits are resolved as S3 plus 1 per
extra rank up to S5. Ranks count if at least 4 wide. A single
character in the front rank will not effect the unit’s fire."
S. US White Dwarf #258 page 40

*****

Q. How exactly do Chaos Dwarf Blunderbusses work with the Stand
and Shoot charge reaction?

A. The rules are applied exactly as with any other unit.  If the
chargers start within 12" then any models within 12" may be hit.
If the chargers are outside 12", the charging unit is stopped at
maximum range as normal, and so in this case only the front rank
of the charging unit will be in the zone of fire.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. Do Blunderbuss units need line of sight and range to a
declared enemy target unit in order to shoot?

A. Yes, as no exceptions to the main rulebook requirements for
these items are listed in the Blunderbuss special rules.  Note
however that all enemy models caught in a Blunderbuss unit's
'fire zone' will be hit as normal, regardless of whether or not
they belong to a enemy unit which the Blunderbuss unit has LoS to.
S. Ravening Hordes page 32 / Rulebook page 58

*****

Q. Do enemy characters / champions hit by a Blunderbuss unit's 'fire
zone' receive a Look Out Sir! roll (provided there are five or more
rank and file models in the unit with them)?

A. Yes. This falls under "other missiles not governed by the normal
target restrictions (concerning characters)" as stated in the Look
Out Sir! section of the Rulebook.

Q. If the special ability of the Dark Mace of Death is used against
a character on a monstrous mount or in a chariot, how are the
wounds distributed?

A. If a target is riding a monster or chariot, then both the rider
and the monster or chariot take D3 wounds, with no armour saves
allowed.

As this question is not specifically answered by the
Rulebook, the Direwolf FAQ Council has used the detailed
description of the Tomb Kings magic weapon, The Destroyer of
Eternities, which states "If a target is riding a monster or
chariot, then both take two automatic hits." in conjunction with
the answer given in Warhammer Chronicles 2004 that 'both the
Character and the Mount/Chariot take a wound/hit' from magic spells
which cause a wound/hit to each model to arrive at this anwer.

Q. Are Flying moves affected by the Earthshaker's special rules?

Q. Do Chaos Dwarfs benefit from the Dwarf special rules of

do not benefit from these special rules.
S. Ravening Hordes page 32

*****

Q. Are Chaos Dwarfs players suppose to use the Orcs & Goblins
Army Book?

A. Yes. In US White Dwarf #250 on page 11 it states:

Ravening Hordes - Chaos Dwarfs

The new Orc & Goblins Army book completely replaces the list
in Ravening Hordes. However, dedicated Orc & Goblin armies
are not the only ones to employ the Greenskins in battle. The
Chaos Dwarfs also use them and, as the complete rules are now
out, it will be good to use them for the Chaos Dwarf's slave
troops, too. To do this you'll obviously need both Ravening
Hordes and the new Orc & Goblins book. The following changes
bring the list up to date:

- Replace the Special unit entries in Ravvvvveeening Hordes for the
Orc Boyz, Goblins and Black Orcs with the following army list
entries  from the Orc & Goblin Armies book: Goblins, Orc Boyz,
Orc Arrer Boyz and 0-1 units of Black Orcs. One unit of Orc
Boyz may be upgraded to Big'Uns as per the normal rules in
the book. All these units count as Special units in the Chaos
Dwarf army.

- Delete special rule 5 about Orcs ignoriiiiinnng panicking Gobbos
(this is replaced by the full rules from the book)

- Troops described in the Orc & Goblin booooooook follow the rules
there rather than the shorthand versions in Ravening Hordes.

- Hobgoblins suffer Animosity just as a uuuuunnnit of Goblins would
in the Orc & Goblin book. This replaces the animosity rule in
Ravening Hordes (special rule 3).

Q. May Greenskin units in the Chaos Dwarf army use the magic
banners from the Orc & Goblin army book?

A. No they may not. Greenskins in a Chaos Dwarf army are not
part of a free Orc and Goblin Waaagh!, they are slaves and do
not have access to the magic banners in the Orcs & Goblins book.
Note however that due to the White Dwarf update (see Q&A above)
a unit of Orc Big 'Uns and Black Orcs may carry the magic

*Context: The GLWL was a premier 6th Edition tournament circuit. Their historic rulings on base sizes, Unit Strength, and Ravening Hordes integration remain the global standard for competitive play and are hardcoded into this engine.*

### 1. Base Size and Unit Strength Clarifications
**Ruling:** Despite early printing ambiguities, Tomb Kings Tomb Scorpions must be mounted on 50mm square bases and are strictly Unit Strength 4. Furthermore, the Regiment of Renown character Bronzino is Unit Strength 2 as he is mounted on a horse.

## ⛰️ Part 3: The Norn Consensus

*Context: Established in 2003, The Karak Norn Wargaming Club provides the Norn Consensus: a compilation of rules resolutions and tournament precedents debated by the Karak Norn Longbeard circle during the original 6th Edition era (2003-2006). This section documents their structural resolutions, translating unresolved tabletop edge-cases into the strict mechanical logic required by digital list-builders. (Note: The digitization of the historical archive is an ongoing process. Additional rulings will be indexed here as they are translated for engine compatibility.)*

### BRETONNIA
**Q:** Can a Bretonnian Character benefit from both *Stubborn* and *Immune to Psychology* at the same time through the Virtue of the Penitent and the Grail Vow?
**Ruling:** Yes. Break tests are not Psychology tests. Because the Virtue and the Vow are inherent, non-magical traits granted by the character's devotion, they completely bypass the Magic vs. Mundane conflict outlined in the official Banner of Sigismund FAQ. The character takes Break tests on unmodified Leadership while ignoring Fear, Terror, and Panic.
**Source:** `[Rulebook pages 85 & 112 / Bretonnia Army Book / The Norn Consensus Historical Precedent]`

### WOOD ELVES
**Q:** Does a Treeman natively benefit from both *Stubborn* and *Immune to Psychology* (via the Forest Spirit rule) in close combat?
**Ruling:** Yes. Because both rules are innate to the creature's profile and not the result of a Magic Item, they do not trigger the Magic vs. Mundane cancellation clause. The Treeman takes Stubborn Break tests on unmodified Leadership while simultaneously ignoring Psychology tests.
