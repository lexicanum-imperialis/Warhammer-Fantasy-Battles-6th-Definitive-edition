Q. Where can I find the corrected Unit Strength table which
replaced the table on page 41 of the Rulebook?

A. In Warhammer Chronicles 2004
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. How does the sole remaining model of a formerly ranked unit move?
For example, if a unit of Empire hangunners is reduced to 1 model,
how does the sole remaining model move?  Does he still have to pay
to wheel, etc.? Does he still cause enemy unit to form up on him?
Or does he follow the Single Models Movement Chart?

A. He moves like a single model on foot - freely, like a character on
foot (and thanks his lucky stars he's still around!).
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. When is Cavalry Not Cavalry?

A. The rule that models on a 25 mm x 50 mm base are classed as cavalry
has thrown up some points regarding beasts such as Chaos Hounds and
Dire Wolves, and creatures like Bull Centaurs. To clarify this:

All models on a 25 mm x 50 mm base have a Unit Strength of 2.

Models on a 25 mm x 50 mm base which consist of a rider on a steed
with a single Wound are classed as cavalry and follow all of the rules
as such.

Models on a 25 mm x 50 mm base which consist of only one creature (such
as a Bull Centaur) are classed as cavalry with the following exceptions:

They do not gain a +1 Armour save.

They may benefit from using two hand weapons, or the hand weapon
and shield bonus, as if on foot.

They use the cavalry rules for spears.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112 / Beasts of Chaos Army Book
page 24

*****

Q. Do units which are bought with the same Troop choice have to be
deployed together?

A. Unless specifically noted otherwise (e.g. war machines, Empire
Detachments, Skaven Weapons Teams) separate units are always deployed
separately.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Can two characters join each other, thus forming a unit? What if
they are mounted on chariots or monsters?

A. Characters may form a unit with each other, only if they are on
foot or a cavalry mount.  Characters mounted on larger creatures and
chariots may not form units at all.  Remember also that characters
on a flying monster may not join a unit of flyers, as described in the
rules for flyers.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Can a hero mounted on a Great Eagle join with another single Great
Eagle (purchased from the special or rare slots of the army) to
form a single US7 unit capable of taking out ranks?

A. No. I know that Flying Unit is an actual sub-category of flyers
but I would think the intent is obvious. To nail it on the head, I
would say that a character on a flying monster cannot join a
unit of flyers or another flying monster.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Can single non-character monsters and creatures, such as Giants,
Spawn of Chaos, etc. join each other, thus forming a unit?

A. No. You cannot form a unit from two Giants, for example, or three
Chaos Spawn.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112 / Gav Thorpe - Warhammer
Design Team (Online Q&A on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can a character join a non-character monster or creature, thus
forming a unit?  For example, could a Goblin Big Boss mounted on
a wolf join a Giant and form a unit?

A. Yes (excluding flying monsters). I always like the idea of a
Goblin Big Boss and his forty feet tall 'minder'…

Workshop Warhammer Forum)

2. MOVEMENT

DECLARING CHARGES

Q. Here is the situation: Friendly unit A is engaged in close combat
with enemy unit B from a previous turn.  In the current turn
friendly unit C, who happens to be in the front zone of enemy unit B,
wants to charge into the combat but the entire frontage of enemy unit
B has already been taken up by friendly unit A.  Is friendly unit C
allowed to charge the flank of enemy unit B?

A. No. I think that if you allow this to happen, you make a mockery
of one of the most important dynamics of Warhammer strategy – moving
your troops into a position to get the most advantageous charge. This
may seem a bit odd, particularly with skirmishers as in this example,
but the rules clearly state that to charge in the flank/ rear, the
majority of the charging unit must be in that zone, and there are no
exceptions. To get a flank or rear charge, you should have to
positively move the unit into a position where it can do this, rather
than simply fill up the front with other stuff.

Co-ordinating units to get simultaneous front and flank charges is
a defining tactic of Warhammer and should be something that is
tricky to achieve, otherwise the game will lose any sense of the
importance of planning and maneuver.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook - page 46

*****

Q. Can a unit redirect a charge against an enemy unit that it could
have originally charged?

A. No. You can only redirect a charge against a unit if you could
not have declared a charge against them normally, but can now do so
due to the enemy fleeing.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. If a enemy unit chooses to flee, and I choose to redirect my charge
against a newly revealed enemy unit, can I both run down the fleeing
unit and charge into the newly revealed enemy unit provided I have
enough movement to perform both actions?

A. No.  First, remember that you do not declare whether or not you
will be redirecting a charge until after the fleeing unit has
completed its movement.  At that point, you must make a decision on
whether or not you wish to chase the fleeing unit or redirect into
the newly revealed enemy unit.  It is critical to follow this order as
in some cases the fleeing unit may not flee very far, and actually
prevent the second enemy unit from being revealed as a target.

CHARGE RESPONSES

Q. How do you determine if a defending unit is ineligible to perform
a stand and shoot reaction?

A. To determine if a unit can perform a stand and shoot reaction, you
must calculate the actual charge movement expended (taking into
account wheels, difficult terrain, etc.) by the charging unit(s).
If one or more charging units can expend half or less of its charge
movement to complete the charge, then the defending unit may not
stand and shoot.
S. Rulebook pages 45, 46, 61 / Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design
Team / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. If a unit fails a charge against a defending unit that has chosen
stand and shoot as a charge reaction, does the defending unit still
get to stand and shoot?

A. Yes, as long as the failed charge brings the charging unit into range
of the defender's missile weapons.
S. Gav Thorpe – Warhammer Design Team / Direwolf FAQ Council
Interpretation

*****

Q. If a character joins a war machine and has a missile weapon, could
he stand & fire with that weapon?

A. Unless specifically acting as crew (ie, an Engineer who used his
ability the previous turn) a character who joins a war machine unit
is not considered crew and so may stand & shoot.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. What happens when the monstrous mount of a rider is killed by a
stand and shoot reaction prior to the monstrous mount beginning
its charge move?  Does the rider continue to attempt the charge?

A. In cases where the stand and shoot is resolved before the charger
moves, the rider will be on foot before the model starting
moving.  In this situation, the rider should attempt to complete
the charge using his own charge move.
S. Rulebook pages 52, 53 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

Q. What happens when the monstrous mount of a rider is killed by a
stand and shoot during its charge move?  Can the rider continue
to attempt the charge?

A. In cases where the stand and shoot is resolved after the charger has
started moving (which only happens if the charger starts out of range
of the defending unit's missile weapons) the charge fails automatically
at the point the monstrous mount was killed.
S. Rulebook pages 52, 53 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

Q. What happens when the chariot a character is riding in is destroyed
by a stand and shoot reaction prior to the chariot beginning
its charge move?  Does the character continue to attempt the charge?

A. In cases where the stand and shoot is resolved before the charger
moves, the character will be on foot before the model starting
moving.  In this situation, the character is allowed to be placed
anywhere within 2" of the destroyed chariot and he should attempt to
complete the charge using his own charge move.
S. Rulebook pages 52, 53, 127 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

Q. What happens when the chariot a character is riding is destroyed by a
stand and shoot during its charge move?  Can the character continue
to attempt the charge?

A. In cases where the stand and shoot is resolved after the charger has
started moving (which only happens if the charger starts out of range
of the defending unit's missile weapons) the charge fails automatically
and the character is placed anywhere within 2" of the destroyed chariot.
S. Rulebook pages 52, 53, 127 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

RALLY FLEEING TROOPS

Q. If a character is in a unit that flees, he flees with the unit.
If the unit is below 25% of its original size, it cannot rally -
character included.  However, what happens if the character is the
only model left in the unit? Is he still part of that unit if he
breaks and flees? Can he then not rally, since his "unit" is below
25% of its original size?

A. If the character is the only one left, the unit has been destroyed
and therefore the character is no longer a part of it. Since the
character is above 25% of their own starting size they will always
be able to rally.
S. July 2002 Q&A Update on the Warhammer Chronicles website

*****

COMPULSORY MOVES

Q. When a unit that utilizes random compulsory movement (e.g. Chaos
Spawn, Snotling Pumpwagon, etc.) pursues another unit off the board,
and returns in its next compulsory move phase, can its move that
turn take it into contact with the enemy?

A. Yes.  As units that utilize random compulsory movement do not
declare charges, they are not restricted from coming into contact
with an enemy unit on the turn they return to the table.
S. Rulebook page 76

*****

MOVE CHARGERS

Q. Where can I find guidance on how to align the combatants during
"awkward" charges, charges involving multiple charging units or
target units, and "clipping"?

A. In Appendix Six (Rules Commentary) of the Warhammer Rulebook
S. Rulebook pages 265-268

*****

Q. In the Appendix Six (Rules Commentary) guidance covering charges
involving multiple charging units, it indicates that the player moving
the charging units must divide evenly the frontage of the target unit
between the charging units and shows examples of how to resolve this
using ranked units.

When one or more of the charging units is a single model (such as
a chariot, giant, lone character, etc.) does the rule on page 268
about equally dividing the frontage of the target unit between
the charging units still apply?

A. Yes, the rule about splitting the frontage of the target unit
still applies.  The Appendix Six (Rules Commentary) guidance does not
provide an exception for single models.  The maximize chargers rule
found on page 52 of the Rulebook is still applied, however it is simply
applied to the portion of the target unit each charging unit has been
allocated.  Note that resolving the alignment of the combatants
in this manner has the important benefit of reducing clipping
situations.
S. Rulebook page 268 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

Q. During the move chargers step of the movement phase, if a charging
unit catches an enemy unit which just fled from their charge (thus
destroying the fleeing unit) and the charging unit's full charge move
would move it into contact with an additional enemy unit, does this count
as pursuit into fresh enemy?  Or is the charging unit forced to stop 1"
away from the additional enemy unit as a charge (or redirected charge)
was not declared against it?

A. The rules do not allow us to come into contact with an enemy unit
during the Move Charges step of the movement phase unless A) valid
charge or re-directed charge was declared against the enemy unit we wish
to contact or B) the unit was "drawn-in" to the combat per the rules
covering multiple targets in Appendix Six of the main rulebook.
Therefore, in the example above, the charging unit is forced to stop 1"
away from the additional enemy unit.
S. Rulebook pages 55, 267 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation.

*****

Q. If an unengaged unit classified as "Moves as a Monster" in the
Single Models Movement Chart is charged in the Flank or Rear does
it have the ability to turn and face the chargers?

A. No. The updates in Warhammer Chronicles replaced the wording on
pages 54 and 55 of the rulebook in regards to flank and rear charges
involving single models. Anything larger than a man sized character on
foot now has a clear front/flank/rear for combat purposes and his
opponent will get the flank / rear bonuses if the model is charged
in the flank / rear.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Warhammer Chronicles 2004
page 114.

*****

Q. Situation: Unit A wants to charge unit B, however there is a patch
of difficult ground in the way. If Unit A goes through the difficult
ground it will fail the charge. If unit A wheels a bit it will be able
to contact the enemy unit, but the wheel will bring fewer charging
models into contact with the enemy than if Unit A was able to complete
the charge by moving straight ahead. Can unit A wheel around the
difficult terrain to make the charge in this situation?

A. Yes. As outlined in the Charging rules, the first rule of charging is
to bring as many models from the charging unit into combat as possible.
As "fewer" is greater than "zero", Unit A must perform the wheel and
complete the charge.
S. Rulebook page 52 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Single Models that move "As Monsters" or "As Skirmishers" are 
described as "no need to turn or wheel" and can "pivot on the spot
with no penalty".  Does this mean these models can zig zag or 
otherwise change direction several times while charging?

A. No. When charging, move single models exactly like other units,
except instead of the single wheel allowed, the model may be rotated
once in place for no movement penalty.  In other words, single models 
can only change direction once when charging.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114 / Direwolf FAQ Council 
Interpretation

*****

Q. What happens when the charging rules would force a charging unit 
to move off the board?  For example: a target of a charge flees, is 
caught, and the required full charge move through the target's final 
position ends would take the charging unit off the board.  Is the charging 
unit moved off the board, or is it stopped at the table edge? 

A. Simply move the chargers off the table and then allow them to return 
next turn, in the Remaining Moves phase, as normal. 
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team 

*****

REMAINING MOVES

Q. Can you change the position of a character within a ranked up
unit in the movement phase?

A. As long as you’re not charging, you can change the position
of a character, though he must still remain in the front rank
if possible (except for Skaven...).
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. When a unit that pursued another unit off the board returns, do you
place the entire unit back on the table and then move it, or do you
expend movement to move it back onto the table?

A. I always play it that the unit has to physically move on to the
table, as if its front rank started the phase touching the outside
edge of the board. This isn't directly supported in the rules,
but is the intent.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If a unit has pursued another unit off the board, when in its
following movement phase does it arrive back on the battlefield?

A. It arrives back on the battlefield when it would normally move.
So, most units would arrive back on the battlefield in the Remaining
Moves phase (as they cannot charge). Units like Spawn of Chaos will
arrive back in the Compulsory Moves phase (otherwise they would never
actually get back onto the table!)
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. A unit that pursued another unit off the board is said to arrive
back in the same place that it left the board. What happens if your
opponent has placed a unit in that place?

A. Move the unit back on as close to the position it left as possible.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If a ranked unit that somehow didn't have enough movement to get
its entire formation back onto the table (i.e. Dwarfs in
difficult terrain) should we just 'fudge' it and let them come back
on the table?

A. Correct! This also happens to deep infantry units, with enemy
units close by that stop marching.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If at the start of a turn, enemy units are within 8" of the
position where a unit must re-enter the table, does it prevent the
re-entering unit from marching?

A. Yes.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

+++++

3. SHOOTING

+++++

Q. If a character is further away than a friendly unit in combat,
can they he targeted with shooting?

A. A character can be picked out if he is the closest 'target'.
Target means a unit that the shooting models are allowed to
shoot at, and so would not normally include units in combat, and
certainly doesn't include units that are out of line of sight.
Of course, this can make things difficult for Skaven, but that's
what happens when you give a rat a machine-gun...
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Can models behind the first rank see large targets and shoot
at them?

A. Yes they can.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. The rules on targeting characters mounted on monsters are causing
us a few problems.  So, when does a monster count as being bigger
than cavalry?  For example, the Empire Pegasus comes with a 40mm
base, but a Wood Elf Unicorn from the Preview Army List has a
cavalry base?

A. Yes, some difficulty arises because over the years some
monsters have been mounted on a variety of base sizes.  As we go
through the Army books and miniatures range (in 6th edition), all
monsters will eventually be packaged with 40mm or 50mm bases.

Any mount with more than 1 Wound is a monster and is treated as
being larger than cavalry for the purposes of targeting.  Anything
that is a 'large target' is bigger than anything else, including
other monsters.

If you have monsters on cavalry bases to fit with your units, we
suggest you mount them on 50mm bases (like Daemonic Mounts and
Tyrion's mount, Malhandir).  This helps the unit rank up more
easily.  If they are normally fielded as independent models, such
as a Pegasus, a 40mm base is fine.

Models on 40mm and 50mm bases are treated as the same size for
purposes of targeting unless they are a large target.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. For purposes of targeting characters, are Models on 20mm and 25mm
square bases treated as the same size?

A. Yes.  Both base sizes are used for characters considered to be
roughly man sized and on foot and are treated as the same size for
purposes of targeting.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114 / Direwolf FAQ Council
Interpretation

*****

Q. Can single models that are smaller than the unit they are adjacent 
to (e.g. a single character on foot adjacent to a unit of 5+ cavalry 
models) claim the "proximity" rule and thus be protected from 
standard shooting attacks?

A. Yes.  A character in close proximity to a rank and file unit of 5+ 
models can only be singled out if he is larger.  Note that the
only current specific exemptions to the "proximity" rule discuss
a larger model. 
S. Rulebook pages 97, 98 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q, If a character model joins a unit of 5+ rank and file models 
of a larger size (e.g. an Orc Big Boss joining a unit of 7 Trolls) 
can he be picked out as a target for standard shooting attacks or is 
he "protected"?

A. He is protected.  There are no rules that state that the rank 
and file models providing the "protection" can't be larger.
S. Rulebook pages 97, 98 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Can models outside the range of missiles (mundane or magical) be
killed?

A. Yes.  In Warhammer, the targeting and the removal of casualties is
done on a unit basis rather than on an individual model basis as
in other game systems.  This means that as long as one model in a target
unit is within range of the firing/casting models, then the entire
target unit is subject to being killed.

Note however that it is the owning player who removes casualties from
his units.  Casualties are removed from the back ranks of ranked units,
and as the owning player wishes in regards to skirmishing units.  This
means that the owning player may remove casualties from the back of
skirmishing units in order to preserve those models that are closest
to the enemy.
S. Rulebook pages 58,65

*****

Q. When a template weapon hits dead on a rider of a large monster
(or chariot) does the 'big hit' for being directly under the hole
of the template affect them both, or just the character?

A. In this case, a hit anywhere on the base of a chariot or
monster (including hitting the rider) should be randomised to
determine where the 'big' hit actually hits.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. With "Multiple Shots" missile weapons that have three (or more)
multiple shots, do you simply apply a -1 to hit modifier to each of
the shots, or is the -1 modifier cumulative (e.g. -1 for the second
shot, -2 for the third shot, etc.)?

A. Simply apply a -1 modifier to each of the shots.  No specific
mention or example of the penalty being cumulative exists.
S. Rulebook page 90 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Can a non-deviating template such as dragon breath target an
enemy unit engaged in close combat, if the template can be positioned
to not hit the friendly unit ?

A. No, you can’t target an enemy unit engaged in hand-to-hand
combat (except for special rules like Skaven).
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Do flame template weapons such as breath weapons and the steam
cannon require Line Of Sight?

A. Yes.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. A throwing axe has two different ranges listed. I assume that
6" is correct (from pages 93 & 94 of the Warhammer rulebook) rather
than 4" (from page 58).

A. Yes, 6" is correct.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Fleeing units move in disorganised mass ignoring obstacles/terrain,
they seem to follow all the rules of skirmishers. Does this mean that
like skirmishers, shooting at them is at -1 to hit ?

A. No. They don’t really follow any of the rules of skirmishers, they
merely ignore terrain while they are running frantically (and
randomly)!
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If shooting a bolt thrower at a fleeing unit will I have the
possibility to penetrate ranks? They move in a loose formation so
how should I determine which zone the bolt thrower is shooting in?

A. A bolt thrower shooting at a fleeing unit will only ever hit
one model.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. When shooting a Bolt Thrower at a unit of skirmishers, can you
hit more than one skirmisher model?

A. No.  Skirmishers do not form into ranks outside of close combat 
and thus the maximum amount of models that can be hit by a Bolt
Thrower is one.  Note that a skirmish unit is required to adopt the
loose skirmish formation as soon as combat ends.
S. Rulebook pages 116, 124  

*****

Q. A skirmishing unit with two models outside of the woods, and the
rest in the woods are shot at by a unit of archers.  Does the
skirmishing unit count as being in soft cover?

A. No. Having part of your unit out of cover is like being a little bit
pregnant. Either you're completely in cover or you're not. If the unit
shooting has line of sight to any models that aren't in cover, the
unit being shot at can be targeted without the cover penalty. The
same answer would apply if the situation involved a ranked unit with
the front rank outside of the woods and the remainder of the unit
inside of the woods.
S. Rulebook page 62 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. In a situation where a character with a missile weapon is riding
a creature with a shooting attack, such as a breath weapon, may the
rider and mount pick different targets or must they shoot at the same
target?

A. In general, the normal rules for shooting apply. If there is a
unit which can be reached by the shooting attack with the shortest
range, the model cannot Divide Shots. Otherwise (i.e., no unit can
be reached by both shooting attacks) the Divide Shots rule applies
and the shooting attacks can choose different targets. Note that
if the only target within range of the breath weapon and the missile
weapon is a single model, the Divide Shots rule also applies and
the shooting attacks can choose different targets.
S. Rulebook pages 61,114 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

4. CLOSE COMBAT

+++++

Q. When exactly do you calculate the various Combat Resolution
modifiers?

A. The only Combat Resolution modifier which is calculated at the
beginning of each round of combat is rank bonus.  All other modifiers
are calculated at the end of each round of combat.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If a unit charges into the rear/flank of an enemy, but in the
ensuing Close Combat phase is reduced down to a Unit Strength less
than 5, does it still cancel ranks?  And can it still gain the
flank/rear bonus?

A. Rank bonus is claimed and calculated at the start of the
Close Combat phase, so the rank bonus is nullified this turn. The
flank/rear bonus is calculated at the end of the Close Combat phase,
so the attacking unit can't claim it since it has been reduced to
Unit Strength less than five.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Is the combat results example in Fig. 3 on page 72 of the Rulebook
incorrect?

A. Yes, the example is wrong because the Empire should no longer
gain a flank bonus.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Can a unit engaged in the flank/rear turn to face its attackers in
subsequent rounds of combat?

A. No. In the Redress the Ranks section on page 76 it states
"...affords victors the chance to adjust their formation by expanding
their frontage or lapping around."  No mention of turning to face the
attackers is made.  Once your unit is hit in the flank or rear, your
unit’s facing is stuck until the combat is over.
S. Rulebook page 76

*****

Q. Who strikes first when two units are charging? For example, if
you pursue into fresh combat and then in the enemy’s turn the
pursuing unit is charged.

A. When a combat involves charging units from both sides, the chargers
strike in the order in which they charged.  However, models may not
strike against an enemy that has charged them until that charging unit's
attacks are resolved.  All units striking first are allowed the normal
charge bonuses for lances, etc.  A unit hat has been charged and is
not charging itself will always strike after all charging units - only
the order of the charger's attacks are relevant.  Note that Empire
detachments have their own special rules so that when counter-charging
they will always strike first.  However if not specifically counter-
charging then the strike order above is used.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 16

*****

Q. Can a unit consisting of one rank "lap around" the enemy with
unengaged models if it wins a round of close combat?  Can a ranked unit
"lap around" to its flank?

A. Yes to both. See the White Dwarf article "A Commentary on the Finer
Points of Lapping Round" for more detail.
S. Rulebook page 77 / US White Dwarf #283 pages 22-25 /
UK White Dwarf #283 pages 74-77

*****

Q. If a unit engaged in close combat has lapped around its enemy,
where are its casualties removed from?

A. From the back of the unit, not from those models lapping
around – unless of course there are no models in the back rank!
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Does a unit that has lapped around the enemy, need to have models
with a Unit Strength of 5+ lapped around in order to earn the flank 
or rear bonus?

A. No.  You can lap around with a single Unit Strength 1 model to 
the flank (or rear) of the enemy and still earn the flank (or rear) 
bonus.  It is the Unit Strength of the entire unit that is required 
to be 5+ to earn the bonus, not the models lapping around.
S. Rulebook pages 77, 78

*****

Q. If my unit is engaged to the front of an enemy unit, can I negate 
the enemy unit's rank bonus by lapping around?

A. No.  Lapping around does not negate the enemy's rank bonus.
S. Rulebook pages 77, 78

*****

Q. If a unit chooses to expand frontage during combat is this
considered to be a true formation change, or does the unit revert
to its pre-combat formation at the end of the combat?

A. This is considered to be a true formation change.
S. Rulebook page 77 / Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

Q. If the Initiative value is equal between the two models and the
roll off is also a tie, do you actually strike simultaneously?

A. No, roll off until you have a winner.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. I have two units attacking one enemy unit, one from the front and
the other on the flank. Due to casualties being removed, the enemy
unit now only has models in contact with the 'front' unit. Has this
legally brought my flanking unit out of combat and thus allow it to
make an overrun move?

A. No, there are still models remaining in the unit it is engaged in
combat with. In this case, the easiest thing to do is ‘fudge it’
slightly - just slide the flanking unit across a little so that it
is in contact with at least one enemy model.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. I have two units attacking two enemy units all embroiled in a single
combat.  During the combat one of my units wiped out the only enemy
unit which it was in base to base contact with. Does my unit still
count as being in combat, or is it free to act independently in
subsequent turns?

A. All units involved in a combat are subject to combat resolution and
resulting Break tests.  However, if a unit is no longer in contact with
the enemy due to the elimination of the only enemy unit it was in
contact with, it does not count as being in combat in subsequent turns
and thus can charge, shoot, be shot at, and so on.
S. US White Dwarf #283 page 24 / UK White Dwarf #283 page 76

*****

Q. In a situation where one side is completely wiped out in a combat,
do you still have to determine the combat's result?

A. No! If one side is completely wiped out, the other side has won
with no need for a Break Test.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 121

*****

Q. How do you work out close combat attacks that do multiple wounds
against units of creatures with multiple Wounds (such as Trolls,
Ogres, or Fellbats)?

A. When fighting rank and file troops with more than one Wound, use
the same procedure you would for normal troops.  Roll to hit, roll to
wound, make saves.  After this, roll for each wounding hit to see how
many actual wounds are inflicted by the weapon.  The maximum number
of wounds per hit is the number of Wounds the enemy models have.

For example if you have a magic sword that does D3 wounds and are
fighting Fellbats (which have 2 Wounds each), you would have to count
results of 3 as 2 wounds inflicted.

Once the total number of wounds have been rolled, add them all up
and remove whole models as normal.  To continue the previous example,
if you did 1, 2, and 3 wounds from three hits, this is 5 wounds and
so you remove two Fellbats and one Fellbat has a single wound
remaining.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. How do you kill a champion in close combat?

A. To kill a champion in close combat, the enemy must generally
specifically allocate attacks at the champion. Unless specifically
noted otherwise (as in the case of the champion in a Tomb Kings
Light Chariot unit), if no attacks are allocated at the champion, 
the champion will still be killed if enough wounds to kill all
rank and file members of the unit are inflicted. While Champions may 
have differing weapon skills, abilities, and in some instances carry 
magic items, they are still considered to be rank and file members of 
the unit.
S. Rulebook page 109 / Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If you didn’t allocate any attacks in close combat at an enemy
champion but cause enough wounds to kill the enemy's front rank, do
you remove the enemy champion?

A. No.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If attacks allocated on the champion cause more unsaved wounds than
the champion has on his profile, are the excess unsaved wounds lost?

A. In a non-challenge situation the excess unsaved wounds are lost.
Per the Warhammer Rulebook Errata excess unsaved wounds on a champion
no longer carry over onto the rank & file.  Note however that in a
challenge situation, the enemy can score up to +5 overkill points
over the champion’s wounds characteristic.
S. Rulebook pages 99, 109 / Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 121

*****

Q. Can Champions be moved into a fighting position in the same way as a
character can, as described on p.97 of the Warhammer rulebook
(Moving Characters Within Engaged Units)?

A. No, they cannot. Champions remain part of the command group at the
center of the front rank of their unit.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If attacks allocated on the rank and file cause more unsaved wounds
than there are rank and file members of the unit, do the excess wounds
carryover onto a character attached to the unit?

A. No.  If attacks are allocated against ordinary troops, then any
excess wounds caused by those attacks are not carried over onto
enemy characters fighting alongside them.
S. Rulebook page 98 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Does a standard bearer / battle standard bearer have to be alive at
the end of the combat round to contribute the +1 to combat resolution
and/or combat resolution effects of a magic banner?

A. Yes.  The standard bearer / battle standard bearer must be alive at
the end of the combat to provide the +1 CR and/or the combat resolution
effects of a magic banner he/she was carrying.  This includes banners
that increase rank bonuses or negate rank bonuses.
S. Rulebook pages 71, 78 / Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 120

*****

Q. If a unit has only it’s command group left, and removes the
standard bearer, does that deny the enemy from collecting victory
points for the standard?

A. If the standard bearer is removed as a casualty, then the enemy
will only get the victory points for capturing it if the unit is
destroyed completely in the same round of combat, or the unit flees
and is pursued in that same round of combat.

FLEEING AND PURSUIT

Q. Have there been any articles written which provide additional
guidance on how to move fleeing and pursuing units?

A. Yes. See the Warhammer Annual 2002.
S. Warhammer Annual 2002 pageS 10-12

*****

Q. What happens when a unit making a pursuit move hits a unit which
is already fleeing from another combat?

A. If a pursuing unit would move into a fleeing unit, the unit will
make another flee move and will either get away or be wiped out
if it can't outdistance its foe.
S. Rulebook page 75 / Warhammer Annual 2002 page 16

*****

Q. If you break two enemy units, you can only pursue one of them.
What if your pursuit move brings you into contact with the fleeing
unit that you didn’t pursue?

A. The pursuing unit will go around that unit if at all possible.
This may involve an amount of ‘fudging’ of both units (perhaps to
make this happen, you could push the fleeing unit slightly to the
side so that the pursuers can get past them, for example). If utterly
impossible, as a last resort, halt the pursuers 1” away from the
fleeing unit (remembering that they still catch and kill the other
unit if they rolled higher than its flee roll, regardless of how far
they actually move).

OVERRUN

Q. Can a unit make an overrun move if it is charged and wipes out the
chargers?

A. Yes, any unit that wipes out its enemy in the first round of combat

Q. What happens when a unit making an overrun move hits a unit which

5. PSYCHOLOGY

+++++

Q. Is a Break Test a type of psychology test?

A. No. Break tests are leadership tests but are not one of the defined
psychology tests per the Psychology section of the Rulebook.
Therefore, units with the ability to re-roll failed psychology tests
may not re-roll failed break tests and items which allow the re-roll
of failed break tests do not allow the re-roll of failed psychology
tests.
S. Rulebook pages 74, 80

*****

Q. Is a rally test a type of psychology test?

A. No. Rally tests are leadership tests but are not one of the defined
psychology tests per the Psychology section of the Rulebook.  Units
with the ability to re-roll failed psychology tests therefore may not
re-roll a failed rally test.
S. Rulebook pages 75, 80

*****

Q. If a unit has to take multiple psychology tests at the start of
a turn (panic, terror, stupidity, etc.) or at the same time during a
turn (e.g. a unit is previously engaged in combat and charged in the
flank by a fear causing enemy unit) in what order should the tests be
taken?

A. The tests should be taken in the same order as they are listed in
the Psychology section of the Rulebook.
S. Rulebook page 79

*****

Q. How does psychology work with monster mounts (and chariots) and
their character riders? Does the rider’s psychology take precedence?

A. The character’s psychology takes precedence. So, if the character is
Immune to Psychology, the entire model is Immune to Psychology. Also, if
a character rider is frenzied, then it must always charge (using the
movement of the monster). However, there are some exceptions to this.
These exceptions are : Fear, Terror, Stupidity and Frenzy. A Fear or
Terror causing monster (or chariot) passes on immunity to fear/terror
to its rider. If the monster (or chariot) suffers from Stupidity, or is
subject to Frenzy, then these are out of the control of the rider, and
the entire model may suffer from it. In all other cases, the entire
model uses the character rider’s psychology.

Further Direwolf FAQ Council clarification: In these cases where the 
mount's Stupidity or Frenzy affects the rider, it is the movement effects,
not the close combat effects.

*****

PANIC

Q. When a unit sustains 25% or more casualties from friendly fire
(e.g. mortar scattering, Skaven Life is Cheap fire) does the unit have
to take a Panic check at the end of the phase?

A. That would come under 'voluntary tests'. By the strict letter of
the rules, only casualties in the enemy magic and shooting phases
apply. However, as well known, friendly fire isn't friendly at all,
and I would probably take a panic test if one of my units suffered
self-inflicted casualties in this way.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. When a war machine unit, Skaven Weapons Team, wizard, etc. destroys
itself via a misfire, malfunction, miscast, etc. do friendly units
within 4" have to take a Panic check at the end of the phase?

A. No test required. The panic test for friends destroyed is very
specific about enemy magic and shooting again. In this case, most
soldiers are just waiting for the wizard's head to explode or the
whirly-gun of doom to blow itself up. They're pretty used to this
type of behaviour.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Is a unit that passes a break test immune to taking panic tests
for friendly broken or destroyed units within 6" in the same turn?

A. No.
S. Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. Is the panic test for a nearby friendly unit breaking from combat
contingent upon the relative sizes of the broken unit and the unit
that might have to test?

A. No. Even single models with less than five wounds on their
original profile that break in combat force nearby friendly units to
take panic tests.
S. Rulebook page 80

*****

Q. If a friendly single model with less than 5 wounds on its original
profile is destroyed by missile fire or magic, does it cause a panic
test for friendly units within 4"?  Do single models with less than
5 wounds on their original profile cause panic tests in any
situations?

A. In the Warhammer Chronicles Errata section, the wording on
page 81 of the Rulebook was changed to exclude single models with
less than 5 wounds on their original profile from causing Panic tests
when destroyed by missile fire or magic.  Such models also do not
cause panic tests if they are destroyed in close combat.  Note however
that such models DO cause panic tests in friendly units within 6" if
they break from close combat and if they are fleeing and have higher
unit strength than friendly units within 4" at the start of a turn.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 125 / Rulebook pages 80, 81

*****

Q. If a unit has only one model left in the turn that it is destroyed in
combat, does a friendly unit nearby have to make a Panic test (ie, does
the last model remaining in the unit count as being a single model)?

A. This is determined at the start of each phase - if it's a single
model at that point, then its destruction won't cause panic.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. Concerning panic from flank and rear charges, the rules say that you
use the Unit Strength (five or more) to require the check, but then
say at the end that no test is required if the charging unit numbers
less than five models.

A. Delete the last sentence. Unit Strength 5 is the only requirement
needed to determine whether a test is required.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. Do failed panic tests "cascade"? That is, does a unit failing a panic
test force nearby friendly units to take a panic test (as failing a
break test does)?

A. No. Panic does not cascade. If, in the player's subsequent turn, the
unit that panicked is still fleeing and is close enough to friendly
units to force them to take a panic check, one must be taken. None of
the listed cases for taking a panic test is based on another friendly
unit failing a panic test.
S. Rulebook pages 80, 81.

*****

FEAR

Q. When do you resolve Fear tests for an enemy unit that wishes to
stand & shoot?

A. Use the following procedure: The Fear causing unit declares a
charge. The charged player says, "The unit will stand and shoot."
Check to see if the charging unit is in range; if it is, then the
charged unit must take a Fear test. If it fails the test and is
outnumbered, it will flee as normal and not make its stand and
shoot charge reaction. If for any reason it does not flee, then the
charged unit may stand & shoot as normal.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. How do you resolve situations where a single model causing fear is
in the front rank of a unit that does not cause fear?

A. If a single model (e.g. a character) that causes fear is in a unit
that doesn't cause fear then any tests or effects that the fear causes 
is only applied to that character, not the entire unit he is with. 

For example, a unit would have to take a fear test if a unit with a
single fear causing model in it charges them. However if that test is 
failed then the unit only flees if the fear causing character by itself
has a higher Unit Strength than the unit being charged. If the test is 
failed and the unit requires 6's to hit, then it is only 6's to hit the 
single fear causing model, not the rest of the unit he is with.  

In an instance where a unit declares a charge against an enemy unit with
a single fear causing model and the unit declaring the charge will come 
into contact with the single fear causing model, then the unit declaring
the charge must also take a fear test and, if the fear test is failed, 
the unit will not charge.  
S. Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. For purposes of determining if fear causing units outnumber their
foes to force an auto-break situation, do you determine it by the
largest fear causing unit engaged in the combat or do you use the
total Unit Strength of the fear causing units and compare it to the
defender's combined Unit Strength?

A. Neither. If a unit is outnumbered by fear-causing enemies, then
it automatically breaks. Operative word is unit, not side, so it is
worked out on its Unit Strength versus total Unit Strength of fear-
causing enemies it is actually fighting (i.e. in base to base contact
with), in the same way that break test are rolled for individually
rather than per side.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook - page 81

*****

Q. Does placing a fear (or terror) causing character in a unit
actually make the unit immune to fear (or terror)?

The Fear / Terror liability section on page 82 of the Rulebook states
"Obviously a large monster is less likely to suffer from fear or
terror itself. There is not way a huge Dragon is going to be scared
of a Troll for example. These special liabilities also apply to any
rider of a large monster (or steed) too, so a Dragon rider wouldn't
be afraid of a creature that would frighten him on foot. They also
apply to units that are accompanied by fear or terror causing
creatures, a skink unit with a Kroxigor would be immune to fear
for example."

Does the last sentence only applied to mixed units such as Rat Ogres
& Packmasters, War Hydras & Apprentices, etc., or does it apply to
characters as well?

A. The way I would see it most easily solved is to say that the
example quoted on page 82 refers only to mixed units including some
models in the unit causing fear, others not - and that it does not
refer to characters at all.

This would mean a fear causing character does not make a unit immune
to fear - and it does say on page 100: "if a unit of troops panics, or
is forced to flee because of a Fear of Terror test, then any character
who is part of the unit must also flee even if he is immune to panic,
fear, or terror."
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Concerning the Fear test, what if your Unit Strength is equal to the
enemy's when you fail the test?

A. Change 'higher' to 'equal to or higher' in the section on being
charged by a fear-causing enemy.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If charged by more than one fear-causing unit, do you test once per
unit, or once only and add up the total number of charging models?

A. Test once per unit, as each is found to be in range.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. Say Shadowblade, or some other Assassin, is in a unit that is charged
by a Fear-causing creature.

The unit fails its Fear test and requires 6's to hit. Does the Assassin
also require 6's to hit, or do you make a separate test on his own,
probably higher, Leadership? In other words, the Assassin cannot pass
on his Leadership to the unit, but does the unit in effect pass on its
Leadership to him?

A. If, for some reason, a Character does not pass hi Ld on to a unit he
has joined, then he may make a separate Ld test. In most cases, this
rule won't make a difference; if the unit flees (from Terror or Panic,
for example), the Character has to flee with it, regardless of Ld
values.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

TERROR

Q. Is there a limit to the amount of Terror tests a unit is
forced to take?

A. Yes, each unit is only forced to take one Terror test per
BATTLE. After taking the first Terror test, units treat Terror
causing units as causing Fear.
S. Rulebook page 81

*****

Q. If a unit is charged by a Terror causing creature (or a unit wants
to charge a Terror causing creature), does the unit have to take both a 
Terror and a Fear test?

A. No. Just a Terror test.  
S. Rulebook page 82

*****

STUPIDITY

Q. What happens if a stupid unit wanders off the board?

A. It counts as having fled the table, and thus the enemy gets the
victory points.

*****

Q. Can a unit suffering from stupidity elect to flee?

A. No.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. If a character that is suffering stupidity is part of a unit that is
not stupid, does the character force the unit to stumble forwards, or
does he leave the unit, allowing the unit to operate as normal?

A. The entire unit stumbles forward at half the character's movement
value or the unit's base movement value, whichever is lower.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the
Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

FRENZY

Q. When exactly do you move frenzied units?

A. Follow this sequence:

1) Declare normal charges; 2) Measure to see if frenzied units must
charge, declare charges for those that have to; 3) Move chargers;
4) Move frenzied chargers.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Are the target units of forced frenzied charges allowed
charge reactions as normal?

A. Yes, forced frenzied charges are treated as normal charges in
regards to charge reactions.  See the Q&A above for the proper
sequence of executing frenzied charges. 
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Would a frenzied unit which lost a combat, auto-break from a
outnumbering fear causing enemy in the same round?

A. First, Frenzied units that lose combat always take break tests,
just like any other unit. Second, the break test isn't to see if you
are defeated. If you have to take a break test you are already
defeated, that's what losing the combat resolution means. So
regardless of the outcome of a break test, a frenzied unit has
already lost its frenzy, just by having to take one.

An outnumbering fear causing enemy will therefore normally
break a formerly frenzied unit, as the state of frenzy is lost
prior to having to take a break test.
S. Rulebook pages 71, 84

*****

Q. Can a unit be frenzied while fleeing (with the use of spells)?

A. No. If for some reason they should still be affected by frenzy,
they regain it as soon as they rally.

HATRED

Q. Situation: Unit A is hates the enemy and is engaged in combat
with enemy unit B.  The combat between Units A and B ends up a draw,
and in the following turn Unit A is then charged in the flank by enemy
Unit C (which unit A also hates).  Will the previously unengaged models
in unit A get to utilize the first round of combat re-rolls vs. Unit C?

A. No, only unit C counts as in "first round of combat" in the situation
above. All models in a unit fight together and unit A is no longer in
"first round of combat" since it was fighting unit B in a previous turn.

IMMUNE TO PSYCHOLOGY

Q. Can a unit that's immune to psychology (or unbreakable or frenzied,
both which also count as immune to psychology) flee from a charge?

A. No
S. Rulebook page 112.

*****

Q. In a situation where a character that is immune to psychology, 
frenzied, or unbreakable is attached to a unit that suffers from 
psychology (e.g. A Chaos Exhalted Champion with the Mark of Slaanesh 
attached to a unit of Marauders) can the unit voluntarily declare "flee"
as the charge reaction, or must the unit hold due to the presence of the
character?

A. The unit may voluntarily declare "flee" as a charge reaction.
It is the unit which declares the charge reaction (and not the character)
and the immunity to psychology of the character does not transfer to the
unit. Also, if they didn't choose to flee but were forced to, the 
character would be dragged along anyway.

Q. Are all units equipped with hand weapons, even if their profile does
not specifically state "hand weapons"?

A. All models are considered to have hand weapons, unless it is
specifically noted otherwise (e.g. the unit's entry would have to state
that the unit is not armed with hand weapons, or only armed with claws,
etc.)

Q. Is there any special order (attacker first?) in which players declare
what weapon the unit uses? Example : Charger says great weapons and then
the defender can decide to use spear or HW+shield...

A. Not really, it doesn’t really come up that much. If there is any
dispute, I’d say the charger’s must declare first.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 112

*****

Q. Page 88 of the Rulebook, top right, says "troops can choose..." etc.
If a unit has multiple weapons (say hand weapon, shield, and spears),
could they opt to have part of the unit pick one weapon, and others
pick another?  Not the unit half armed one way & the rest another, but
all have multiple weapons and just picking different weapons to use.
Or by 'troops', should it really mean the unit as a whole picks one
weapon & uses it for that combat?  Example - the front rank armed with
hand weapon & shield, and second rank in spears?

A. The entire unit chooses the same weapon.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook page 88

*****

Q. Strictly speaking, there is no reference as to striking order for
two Great Weapon-armed non-charging units. The answer seems obvious
(Initiative order) but could be argued (some people say it depends on
who won the previous combat round).

A. It follows normal combat rules: they will strike in Initiative
order. If they both have the same Initiative, then the winner of the
previous rounds combat strikes first. As a last resort, roll a dice,
as there are never simultaneous Attacks in Warhammer.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If a character or a unit armed with Great Weapons has a magical item,
or spell cast on them, that allows them to strike first (e.g. Helm of
Many Eyes, Bash Em Ladz), does the spell overrule the normal rules for
Great Weapons striking last?

A. Yes.

*****

Q. Can a unit champion involved in a challenge use a different
equipment option than his unit ? Like a Greatbeard uses Handweapon
and Shield while the rest of the Longbeards in combat use their
Greatweapons.

A. Only if the champion is armed with different weapons than the
rest of the unit. If he is armed exactly the same as the rest of the
unit, then both the champion and the unit must use the same weapon
combinations.

Q. In the first round of close combat after a Stand and Shoot reaction

CHARACTERS

Q. How do characters interact with units of differently sized models?

A.  Unless otherwise forbidden by the rules (or in a Q&A), a
character can always join a unit, regardless of their mount.

A unit always moves at the speed of its slowest model, so if a
character on foot joins a cavalry unit, they would move at the
character’s Movement rate.

A character only gains ‘Look out, Sir!’ if part of a unit of ‘similar
sized models’. The same applies to targeting characters within 5"
of a unit. This does not change, whether they are actually within the
unit or not. So a character on a horse can still be picked out if he
joins a unit of infantry, for example. For these purposes, a character
on a monster base (40mm or larger) counts as being bigger than normal
cavalry.

A character in a chariot cannot join a unit unless it is a chariot
unit, and only a character in a chariot may join with another chariot
or chariot unit.

A character takes up the space of an equivalent number of rank and
file models as their base fills. For example, a cavalry model would
take up one space in the first rank and one space in the second rank
of an infantry unit. These ranks still count as complete if four
‘spaces’ wide or more, whether that space is filled with a rank and
file model or a character. See the diagrams on page 113 of Warhammer
Chronicles 2004 for examples.

Q. There are shooting limitations at characters near units. Can they

S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If two characters are with a unit that captures an enemy standard,
what happens to the captured banner if they are the only survivors?

A. They still have it (and still count as a unit of two models). If
they decide to split up then you can choose which of the characters
retains the
captured standard.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. Do Champions count as rank and file in counting the five models for
the ‘Look Out, Sir!’ and/or the ‘Shooting at Independent Characters’
rules?

A. Yes. Except where noted, a Champion is treated as a rank and file 
model.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

CHALLENGES

Q. If a character is in a unit with only one rank, can he refuse a
challenge, as there are no rear ranks for him to be moved to?

A. If there is space in the single rank for him to be positioned where
he cannot fight, he may refuse the challenge. If the entire rank is
engaged, he cannot avoid the challenge, just as if he were on his own
(the challenger hunts him down like the cowardly dog he is!).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

*****

Q. If a combat involves a single character, can the owning player ever
refuse as challenge? What if there are other friendly units and
characters involved in the same combat?

A. If there is a lone character involved in a combat (even a multiple
combat where there are more characters involved), the owning player’s
side can never refuse a challenge.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the Games
Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can you can use the multiplying affect of multiple wound weapons
to rack up a bunch of overkill on one wound champions (or characters
who are starting the combat round with one wound) in a challenge
situation?

To illustrate: In a challenge, can a Character with 3 Attacks on his
profile and wielding a multiple wound weapon gain +6 combat resolution
points from trashing a unit champion with only one wound on his
profile (or an enemy character starting the combat round with only
one wound)?

A. Number of Wounds doesn't matter, because a character with 3 wounds
reduced to one, or a champion starting with one wound is all the same
for purposes of multiple wound weapons in a challenge. When attacks
are allocated (when excess wounds may be wasted, unlike attacks
against rank and file) then each unsaved wound is multiplied.
In this case, you can tear the champion apart and get your +6 combat
resolution (1 Wound plus up to 5 overkill), even though he has only
one wound.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Annual 2002 page 15

*****

Q. How do weapons/items that affect all models in base to base contact
work when held by a character (or champion) in a challenge?

A. The models engaged in the challenge are considered to be in single
combat during the challenge and may not attack or be attacked by models
outside of the challenge.  Therefore the weapon / item only affects the
opposing model in the challenge (and the bearer if it would normally 
affect him).

Slayer Army List (Skavenslayer Description)

*****

Q. Can a single model (e.g. Lord on a Dragon, Greater Daemon, etc.) 
engaged in an ongoing challenge be charged by another enemy unit?

A. Yes. Simply because a single model is engaged in a challenge
and cannot be attacked by a model outside of a challenge, does not mean 
that it is impossible for an additional enemy unit to charge the single 
model. The enemy may wish to do this to add ranks, Unit Strength, the
flanking bonus, etc. to the overall combat result.

GENERALS & BATTLE STANDARDS

Q. A Battle Standard can only be captured if the Battle Standard Bearer
is killed in close combat, but will he still lose the standard if
broken in combat?

A. A Battle Standard will not automatically drop the banner if it is
broken in combat. However, if he is broken and subsequently run down,
then it is captured.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the Games
Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can a Battle Standard Bearer take any standard, even those that can
only be taken by specific units? For example, can an Orc Battle
Standard take a ’goblin only’ banner (though the effects will only work
if he joins a unit of goblins)? Or can an Icon Bearer take the Icon of
Rakaph (which is Tomb Guard or skeleton warriors only)?

A.The restrictions apply to the bearer. So, an Orc Battle Standard
cannot carry a Goblin only banner. However, an Icon Bearer can carry
the Icon of Rakaph as he is effectively a Tomb Guard character.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the Games
Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can units use the Battle Standard’s re-roll if the Battle Standard
itself is fleeing, but within 12”?

A. No.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 113

+++++

8. MONSTERS

+++++

Q. After the rider or crew is killed, when do you take the
monster reaction test?

A. If you are not in close combat then you take the monster
reaction test at the end of the phase in which the rider or
crew are killed.  If you are involved in close combat the
rules clearly state that the test is not taken until after
the combat is entirely resolved.  If the monster is
victorious in the combat, then it states to take the test
in the first turn when the monster would be free to move
and act normally.

If you lose a combat and flee, but are not caught by the
enemy, the book is silent on when to take the test.  If we
use the timing of a victorious monster as a guide, then the
test should be taken the first turn when the monster would
be free to move and act normally.  Therefore, in cases where
the monster loses a combat and flees, take the monster
reaction test at the beginning of the turn after it rallies.
S. Rulebook page 105 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. If the monster reaction test is failed, when do you apply
the results of the monster reaction chart?

A. It depends on which reaction you roll.  Also remember that
the monster only performs actions in the owning players turn.  
So for example if a result of 1-2 (monster runs away) is rolled 
then it will be applied in the owning player's compulsory movement 
phase. If a result of 3-4 (monster charges) is rolled then it will
be applied at the declare charges step in the owning player's 
movement phase.  If a result of 5-6 (shooting / guarding
the body of its master) is rolled then it is applied immediately
but will only come into play if the monster has a ranged attack
or breath weapon and an enemy unit is within range during the
owning player's shooting phases.
S. Rulebook page 105 

*****

Q. Can a monster utilize its breath weapon(s) if it performs a
March move?

A. No.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. How do mixed units of monsters and handlers that are not defined
as skirmishers (e.g. Dark Elf War Hydras) work?

A. These units do not count as skirmishers even though the models are
not ranked up.  When determining what the unit can charge, or for the
purposes of flank/rear charges by enemy units, use 90 degree arcs
centered on the monster itself.

When the unit is in close combat, it forms up following the rules
for skirmishers - ie those in range get into base-to-base contact,
those our of range form up behind.

The models in the unit move at their own Movement value as long as
they remain within 1" of each other.

Also note that any character allowed to join the unit counts as
'riding' the monster for the purposes of any special rules they may
have.  For example, if a Dark Elf Beastmaster joins a War Hydra unit,
then it does get to ignore Monster Reaction tests if all the "crew"
are wiped out.

9. FLYERS

+++++

Q. Page 106 of the Rulebook under Flyers (First column 2nd para.)
it defines and then says that flyers should be on square bases?  
Is this correct? If so what size? 

A. Yes flyers should be on square bases.  In the future, all 
flyers will also come with square bases of the appropriate size 
(generally 40mm for Fell Bats, Carrion, Terradons, Warhawk Riders,
and other things with a wide wingspan).
S. Rulebook - page 106

*****

Q. How far do flyers move if they fail a charge? 

A. They move their full 20”. 
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A 
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Is a Great Eagle a flying skirmisher?

A. No.  A Great Eagle is NOT classified as a "Unit of Flyers", and is
therefore not a skirmisher.  This means that a Great Eagle is
classified as a monster per the "Unit Strength and Single Model's
Movement" chart found in Warhammer Chronicles.

UNBREAKABLE

Q. Can a character who is not Unbreakable himself, join
an Unbreakable unit?

A. No. Unbreakable units cannot be joined by characters
except those which are already Unbreakable.
S. Warhammer Annual 2002 page 5

*****

KILLING BLOW

Q. Is Killing Blow effective against "Units of Flyers” which consist of a 
flying mount and an approximately man-sized rider?  What about against 
riderless cavalry models such as Bull Centaurs and Centigors? 

A. If a model consists of both a rider that would be placed on a 20mm or 
25mm square base if alone on foot and another creature, but the model 
cannot be separated into components (e.g. Standard Cavalry models, Pegasus
Knights, Terradons, Warhawks, Daemonic Cavalry, etc.), then Killing Blow 
is effective vs. the model as a whole (excluding chariots).

In cases where the model can exist as two (or more) separate parts
and one (or more) of the components would be placed on a 20mm or 25mm 
square base if it was by itself on foot, Killing Blow is only effective 
vs. that component(s) of the model (e.g. a character in a chariot, a 
dragon rider, etc.).

Bull Centaurs and Centigors can not be separated into a component which 
would be placed on a 20mm or 25mm square base (in addition to the fact 
that they are larger than approximately man-sized) and Killing Blow is 
therefore not effective against these models.

*****

REGENERATION

Q. Can a model regenerate if slain by a model with Killing
Blow that rolls a 6 to wound?

A. You cannot regenerate a wound caused by a Killing Blow.
Note that for the purpose of combat resolution, use the
remaining wounds of a model slain by Killing Blow.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. Can a model with Regeneration suffer more wounds than are on
its profile?  In other words, if a Troll suffers 4 wounds
does it have to regenerate all 4 wounds, or only the 3 wounds
on its profile?

A. A model does not suffer more wounds than it started with.  The 
only time excess wounds have any importance is during a Challenge
(see the Overkill discussion below).  As mentioned in a previous
Q&A, an attack that does multiple wounds cannot inflict more wounds
than the model struck has, and they do not carry over from model
to model.

For example a ball from an Empire Great Cannon ploughs through a
unit of Trolls, hitting and wounding three of them.  Each suffers
D6 wounds - let's say the rolls are 6, 5, and 2.  Since no Troll
can take more than 3 wounds (because if the wounds were carried over
a Troll that wasn't hit could take damage, which would be odd), the
number of wounds inflicted is actually 3, 3, and 2.  On average that 
would be 4 wounds regenerated at the end of the phase, so one Troll
is killed outright and the unit has one wound carried over.  Note 
that this does mean that it is potentially tricky to kill the last
model in the unit, as there is always a 50/50 chance of the model
getting back up again, but I guess that's why they call it
Regeneration.

In challenges, this would normally mean no chance of Overkill 
wounds, although I would suspect that hacking apart a regenerating
creature would have just as important an effect on morale as 
obliterating a non-regenerating one.  So, to take this into account,
if the model fails to regenerate, any excess woulds inflicted count 
towards Overkill as normal.  E.g. a Strigoi Vampire Count with the
Curse of the Revenant bloodline power is in a challenge and suffers
5 wounds after its ward save.  It only needs to make three Regeneration
rolls (the number of wounds it had at the start of the combat). 
However, if all three rolls are failed and the Vampire dies, the total
5 wounds inflicted count towards combat results.

Q. Have there been any articles written which provide additional
guidance on how to properly utilize skirmishers?

A. Yes. See the Warhammer Annual 2002.
S. Warhammer Annual 2002 pages 6-8

*****

Q. Have there been any major changes to the rules for skirmishers?

A. Yes, the published errata has five separate cut and paste changes
for page 116 of the rulebook.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 pages 121, 123.

*****

Q. How do skirmishing units form into rows (ranks) when charged by
multiple units?

A. The charging player controls where the skirmishing unit forms
into rows (ranks) as you move the charging units in the order in
which the charges were declared.  Per the updated text and diagrams
covering skirmishers and charges found in the errata in Warhammer
Chronicles, when the skirmishers are charged the charging unit is
brought into base contact with the closest skirmisher model and then
the charging unit is halted. The charging unit is not aligned against
the skirmishing models. The skirmishers form up against the charging
unit as explained in the skirmishing section of the Rulebook and the
charging player then proceeds with further charges.

Therefore, the first step is to move the first unit that declared a
charge into contact with the skirmishing unit.  The second step is for
the skirmishing unit to form up with its front facing that unit.  The
third step is to attempt to move the remaining chargers into contact
with the skirmishing unit.  Note this may result in the skirmishing
unit being hit in the flank or rear by the remaining chargers or for
the remaining charges to fail.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 pages 121, 123 / Rulebook pages 46, 116

*****

Q. While not engaged in close combat, may models in skirmishing
units be in base to base contact with other members of their unit?

A. No. When not engaged in close combat, models in a skirmishing unit
must be positioned up to 1" apart so that they are not touching each
other.
S. Rulebook page 115

*****

Q. What types of characters may join a skirmishing unit?

A. A roughly man-sized character on foot may join a skirmishing unit.
No other characters (mounted, riding in chariots, etc.) can join
skirmishing units.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 121

*****

Q. How do characters and command models (standards, musicians, and
champions) in a skirmishing unit rank up when engaging in close combat?

A. A Skirmishing unit ranked up for close combat should be thought of
like a regular, ranked formation for the duration of the combat. The
Standard Bearer, Musician, Champion, and any characters must generally
be placed in the front rank. However, note that the general Skirmishers
rules do not have special allowances for command and character models
the way the Beast Herd rules do. The rules for Skirmishers may prevent
these models from reaching the front rank, if a model does not have
enough movement to reach the fighting line, or if the ranked up
formation is not wide enough. In that case these models should be
placed in the closest rank to the front they can reach.

When assigning placement due to limited space, the Standard Bearer has
takes precedence and must bump the other models back, then the Musician
and Champion, and characters next.

As noted in their respective sections of the Rulebook, character and
command models add little or no benefit to a unit if they are not in
the front rank. A Standard Bearer will not add +1 to combat resolution,
a Musician will not break a tie, a Champion cannot attack, and
characters are considered "out of the game" (note that if the enemy
somehow engages a Champion or character in a rear rank, they may
fight back as normal).

In subsequent turns a character, if not fighting, may move to replace
a fighting trooper in his movement phase. However, there are no rules
for similarly moving command models within the unit if they are
stranded away from the fighting line. It is suggested players ignore
normal casualty practice, and instead remove killed models from where
the wounds occur in the fighting line. During the Redress the Ranks
phase, models can be shuffled forward to fill the vacated fighting
positions. In this way a stranded Standard Bearer, Musician, or
Champion may reach the front rank. Benefits would apply starting with
the first close combat phase each respective model is in the front
rank.

Q. Can Fast Cavalry shoot on the turn they perform a reform?

A. Yes. Per the errata in Warhammer Chronicles they may shoot even
when marching or reforming.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 123

*****

Q. Fast cavalry can shoot all round, so does this mean they have 360
degree LoS for the purposes of standing and shooting?

A. No. Per the rulebook, "...for charging, stand & shoot reactions,
etc, the model needs to be facing the enemy as normal."
S. Rulebook page 117

*****

Q. Can a Fast Cavalry model use its 360 degree LOS for shooting to
shoot through a friendly model in the same unit?

A. No. If a model in a Fast Cavalry unit can not draw LOS from its
base to its target without going through a friendly model, it may not
fire.
S. Rulebook pages 59, 117

*****

Q. Can a character in a fast cavalry unit shoot in a 360 degree arc?

A. Only if the character himself has the Fast Cavalry rule.  Also note
that characters without the Fast Cavalry rule may not shoot if the
unit marches.
S. Rulebook page 117

*****

Q. Can a wizard in a fast cavalry unit cast spells requiring LoS in a
360 degree arc?

A. No. As specified in the Fast Cavalry rules, the improved LoS only
applies to models with the Fast Cavalry rule and only applies to
shooting.
S. Rulebook page 117

*****

Q. Fast cavalry can shoot all round, so does this mean they have 360°
line of sight for the purposes of the Casket of Souls?

A. No, as described in the rules for fast cavalry, they use normal
line of sight for everything except shooting.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 119

*****

Q. How many reforms may a Fast Cavalry unit perform during a single
turn's Movement phase?

A. Per the errata in Warhammer Chronicles, an unlimited number of
reforms may be performed, though no model may move more than its
maximum movement distance.

*****

Q. Do fast cavalry auto-rally if they flee a charge?

A. No. This was an error printed in the Special Rules Summary Appendix
and subsequently corrected in the Warhammer Chronicles errata.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 124

Q. If a Fast Cavalry unit rallies two or more turns after it
voluntarily flees a charge, can it move in that turn?

A. No. The ability to move is limited to when the unit rallies on
its "NEXT turn".
S. Rulebook page 117

*****

Q. If a Fast Cavalry unit involuntarily flees (from fear, terror,
panic, etc.), and rallies on its next turn, can it move as normal?

A. No. The ability to move upon rallying is limited to when the unit
rallies on the next turn after it has VOLUNTARILY fled a charge.
S. Rulebook page 117

*****

Q. Does a character have to be mounted to join a Fast Cavalry unit?

A. No.  Per the errata in Warhammer Chronicles, any character model
may join a fast cavalry unit and move with the unit, but they do not
benefit from any of the special rules.  However, please note that if
you join a character on foot to a unit of fast cavalry, the character
may slow the unit down as all units are restricted to moving at the
pace of the slowest member of the unit.

*****

Q. When a war machine unit destroys itself via a misfire do friendly
units within 4" have to take a Panic check at the end of the phase?

A. No test required. The panic test for friends destroyed is very
specific about enemy magic and shooting again. In this case, most
soldiers are just waiting for the whirly-gun of doom to blow itself 
up. They're pretty used to this type of behaviour.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

Q. Is a war machine’s crew that is separated from the 
war machine (due to fleeing from combat, panic, etc.) treated 
as a normal unit for purposes of causing panic tests from being 
wiped out, run down by a charging enemy, fleeing past friends, etc.? 

A. Yes.  No exceptions for war machine crews in regards to 
these types of panic tests are given in the Rulebook.  
Remember that if a separated war machine’s crew has been reduced 
to only a single model to apply the panic test exemptions 
given for single models with less than 5 wounds on their

Q. Is it true that if the machine model is destroyed by shooting 
or magic, that the surviving crew have to take a Panic test (assuming

will have some of its models coming across the woods. What happens ? 

A. The pursued unit is destroyed as normal, and the Chariot(s) will 
move into the woods and suffer hits.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114

*****

Q. Is it alright to charge a Chariot in such a way that the Chariot is
only touching a single model in an enemy unit? Basically, is there a 
rule against clipping with Chariots? 

A. Strictly, there is no rule to stop such behaviour, and in some 
cases it is unavoidable or appropriate. However, deliberately turning
a chariot so when it charges it clips the enemy’s unit is bad form, 
and to be frowned upon. See page 266 of the Warhammer rulebook for a 
fuller discussion on the horrid creature that is ‘clipping’. 
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Strictly speaking and according to the rules for Chariots, impact
hits are resolved before combat.  So, can you add the +1 bonus to
Armour save by using a mundane hand weapon and mundane shield 
against the impact hits from a chariot?  

A. Yes.  It's still in the Close Combat phase, just before anything
else happens (with the notable exception that the resolution of wounds 
caused by warpstone vapors from Skaven Clan Pestilens plague censers
is resolved before impact hits).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 114 / Skaven Army book page 32

*****

Q, Do impact hits happen before ‘strikes first’ magic weapons or 
abilities?

A. Yes. 
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. When a friendly character in a Chariot engages in a challenge, how
do we resolve it?

A. Regardless of the challenge situation, a character in a Chariot is
considered to have stepped down from the Chariot for a challenge
and therefore does not benefit from the Chariot's enhancement to 
his armour save.

In addition, regardless of the challenge situation, the Chariot's 
attacks are not lost. If the enemy character engaged in the challenge
is in a unit made up of multiple models, all the chariot attacks 
(impact hits, crew, and beasts) strike the enemy unit. The enemy 
character can only attack the friendly character per the rules for 
challenges, and the enemy unit can attack the friendly Chariot.

If the enemy character is a single model the friendly Chariot can 
attack the enemy character as if the Chariot was in the challenge, 
with one exception: when the enemy character is riding a monster, 
impact hits are applied against the monster, not the rider. In
this situation the enemy character (and his monster) can strike 
either the friendly character or the friendly Chariot.

Also, remember that creatures pulling the Chariot can only attack 
enemy directly in front of them.
S. Rulebook page 128

*****

Q. What exactly is meant by "creatures pulling the Chariot can only
attack enemy directly in front of them"?

A. This means that creatures pulling the Chariot can only attack 
enemy models in their front zone.  This includes enemy models
in corner to corner contact in their front zone.  The creatures
may not attack enemy models in their flank (or rear) zones due to 
the restrictions imposed by harness and reins.
S. Rulebook page 128 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. If a character is engaged in a challenge where he is considered
to have stepped down from his Chariot, and his Chariot is destroyed 
during the combat, does the character still suffer the S5 hit?

A. No. In the opinion of the Direwolf FAQ Council the S5 hit only 
applies to situations where the character is considered to be in the
chariot at the time the chariot is destroyed. As the character has 
lost his armour save bonus due to stepping down from the chariot 
and is considered to be fighting on foot at the time, applying the 
S5 hit for the character being thrown from the chariot does not
appear appropriate in this circumstance.
S. Rulebook page 127 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. In a situation where a Chariot begins a turn stuck in difficult 
terrain (e.g. from pursuit or overrun during the previous close
combat phase, new woods from the Acorn of Ages, etc.) can the
Chariot move (or charge), or is it now stuck for the remainder of 
the game?

A. Strictly by the rules, unless the Chariot is compelled by a
psychology (e.g. frenzy, failed panic test, etc.) to move, then 
it is stuck for the remainder of the game.  Page 127 of the 
Rulebook states "Chariots cannot voluntarily move over obstacles
or difficult terrain...". Note however that it is the opinion of 
the Direwolf FAQ Council that this situation was not thought of
during the writing of the text and the Council recommends that in 
this situation the owning player be allowed to move (or charge) out 
of the difficult terrain (provided the Chariot survives the additional
D6 S6 hits it will immediately take for moving through difficult 
terrain again). 
S. Rulebook page 127 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. If a Chariot that is frenzied or otherwise compelled to charge
an enemy unit in difficult terrain is destroyed from the D6 S6 
hits, and the enemy unit is within 2" of the edge of the difficult
terrain, can a surviving character use the 2" placement move for
being thrown from the Chariot to complete the charge?  

A. Yes, the rules state that you can place the character anywhere 
within 2" of the destroyed Chariot, and there was a legal
charge declared against that enemy unit.  The owning player could 
not place the character into combat with a unit within 2" that the
charge was not declared against.

GENERAL

Q. Do you have to declare the target of the spell before rolling
the casting dice?

A. Yes.
S. Rulebook Page 136

*****

Q. When do you measure range for spells?

A. Once the spell is cast. If you're out of range, you 
wasted the Power and/or Dispel dice.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. What constitutes a ‘remains in play’ spell as discussed in the
last paragraph on page 139 of the Rulebook?

The text that is unclear:
"his opponent is allowed to dispel any spells that remain in play
(key text under debate)......In addition, these spells can be 
dispelled in the player's own magic phase using any Power dice not 
being used to cast spells, as Dispel dice."

A. Only the spells noted with the rule “Remains in Play” or 
“Lasts One Turn” are ‘remains in play’ and follow the rules for such 
creatures. Other spells may endure beyond the current turn, but are 
not ‘remains in play’ and do not follow those rules.

This means that ONLY spells with the specific tag of “Remains in Play”
or “Lasts One Turn” = 'remains in play' per page 139 of the rulebook.
These spells may be subsequently dispelled by an opponent in his own 
turn by utilizing some of his power dice as dispel dice.

If a spell is not tagged as such (and the spell's description doesn't 
specifically grant the ability to dispel it in subsequent turns) then 
the spell provides a lasting effect which can NOT be dispelled in 
subsequent turns.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team / Rulebook page 139

*****

Q. If a Wizard or his unit is engaged in close combat with enemy models
is the Wizard allowed to cast spells? 

A. There is no general rule preventing a Wizard from casting spells while
he or his unit is in close combat, but specific spells may not be castable
in this situation.  Spells specifically defined as "Magic Missiles",
for instance, cannot be cast while the Wizard or his unit is engaged in 
close combat, and some other spells explicitly cover this situation in 
their description.  Further, a spell cannot be cast at a unit in close 
combat unless its description explicitly allows it to do so and many spells
require line of sight. These factors, taken together, generally restrict 
the available targets for the Wizard's spells.  

Note however, that nowhere in the rules does it state that the act of being
engaged in close combat blocks line of sight.....only models and terrain 
block line of sight.  This means that in instances where a Wizard's line 
of sight is not entirely blocked by other models, the Wizard may still be
able to draw line of sight to potential targets. This also means that 
Wizards who are riding on Large Targets or whom are Large Targets by nature
may still be able to draw line of sight to potential targets, even if 
their frontage is fully occupied by enemy models (who are not also Large 
Targets). 
S. Rulebook pages 59, 135, 136, 142  / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Can a single enemy unit be affected by multiple 'Remains in Play'
or lasting effect spells which do not specifically state that
this is allowable / outline the affects?

A. There's no problem with casting multiple spells on the same unit,
and normally the effects will be cumulative – i.e 2 Flames of The
Phoenix would each have chances of causing damage. On one-off effects,
such as Rain Lord, then the effect is a blanket rule which won't be
improved with multiple castings – in this case, you can't make them
any wetter with two spells than you can with one.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If a character has joined a unit and the unit gets affected
by a spell with a lasting effect, will it continue to affect
the character if he leaves the unit?

A. No. The spell affects the unit, and characters can choose to
leave the unit and so be unaffected. Of course, if the unit was
destroyed around him, leaving him the only one in the unit, the
spell would keep affecting him - there is no unit to leave
anymore!
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. If a character is affected by a spell with a lasting effect, 
and he joins a unit, does the spell effect transfer onto the unit?

A. No. The spell effect will continue to effect the character,
but will not be transferred to the unit he has joined.  If
the spell was transferred to the unit, situations would arise where 
the character would no longer actually suffer from the spell (e.g. 
damage spells resolved as shooting hits). Also if the spell was
transferred to the unit, the character could leave the unit in
the following movement phase and no longer suffer from the
spell per the Q&A above!
S. Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Some items can dispel and destroy spells. We can use the
dispel effect to dispel a Bound Spell. Can we destroy it as well?
If yes, is the magic bound spell item completely destroyed or
can it still be used (if it’s a weapon with a bound spell for
example) ?

A. Bound spells can only be destroyed if the item specifically
states in its description that it can do so. In other
circumstances, no, bound spells cannot be destroyed. If the
bound spell in destroyed and the item is a magic weapon, it is
only the spell that is lost- the item is still magical weapon.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. When dispelling spells already in play, do you need to beat
the casting value, or merely equal it?

A. As with other dispels, you need to equal the casting value
to successfully dispel.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Can a fleeing Wizard continue to maintain a Remains in Play
spell, or is the spell removed from play once he flees?

A. The spells continue to take effect until either the Wizard
chooses to end it, the Wizard is slain, the Wizard casts another
spell, or until the Wizard leaves the battlefield (counting as
slain).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. May an magic item, spell, or special ability that allows a player to 
re-roll a D6, be used to re-roll a D3? 

A. Yes.  The instructions in the Rulebook for a D3 begin: "Roll a D6 and 
halve the score."  A player may re-roll the result of a D6 prior 
to halving the result to generate the D3 result. 
S. Rulebook page 37 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

MISCASTS AND IRRESISTIBLE FORCE

Q. In the battle report in White Dwarf 255, the stated tactic of 
Space McQuirk’s Orcs was to use Mork Save Uz to generate re-rolls
that would then allow them to re-roll bad casting dice to prevent
a Miscast, and once even helped generate an Irresistible Force. 
But in the Magic section of the Warhammer book, it states that
re-rolls cannot be used to prevent Miscasts or to generate 
Irresistible Force.

A. Unless specifically stated in the item/spell description, a 
re-roll will not ignore a Miscast nor cause Irresistible Force.
(Space got it wrong).
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. If a Wizard mounted on something (monster, chariot, Screaming 
Bell, etc) Miscasts and is blown D6", what happens?

A. The model does not move and counts as if it had been knocked 
into another model (and both the wizard and the mount take a S10 hit 
per the description in the Miscast Table). If it is on a normal steed 
(not a monster) it gets blown about as normal.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Can Irresistible Force ever be dispelled? The rules say no 
Dispel roll may be attempted, and certain items, such as Dispel 
Scrolls, mention Irresistible Force. However, other items, like the
High Elf Sigil of Asuryan, make no mention of it.

A. Unless specifically written in the description of an item or 
ability, Irresistible Force can never be dispelled. Note that some 
items, such as Sizzla’s Shiny Baubles (an the Orcs & Goblins magic
item), may have an effect on Irresistible Force, but these are 
generally not normal dispels.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. On the miscast result of 4, the spell may be ‘dispelled with
dice as usual’. Can a Dispel Scroll be used in this situation?

A. Yes. It should read ‘dispelled as usual’ rather than ‘dispelled
with dice as usual’.

Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

MAGICAL MOVEMENT

Q. It says that you can't shoot or fight and can't do any other
movement in the Movement phase on the turn you rally, but via
magic you could relocate a rallied unit into contact with the
enemy.  If so, would the unit fight in the Close Combat phase?

A. Yes. They would fight as any other unit.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. What happens when a spell which allows a single character or
unit to charge in the magic phase (ex. Steed of Shadows, Unseen
Lurker, Hand of Gork, etc.) is used to charge a unit which is
already fleeing?

A. The fleeing unit must flee again.  Units that are already
fleeing are an exception to the normal charge response rules.
Whenever a unit successfully charges a previously fleeing unit,
the unit automatically flees again.  Just because they cannot
choose to flee, does not mean they are not forced to.  The
charging enemy destroys the fleeing troops if it catches them,
as normal.
S. Rulebook page 75 / Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

MAGIC MISSILES AND TARGETING

Q. Father of the Thorn is not listed as a "magic missile", its only
requirements for targeting are 24" range and LOS. Can it be cast
upon characters who are within 5" of a unit of five or more similar
sized models? 

A. Yes. As it is not a "magic missile", it does not need to conform 
to normal targeting rules.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Do magic items or abilities that provide special saves against
missiles (e.g. The Golden Eye of Tzeentch, Wristbands of Black Gold,
Shield of Ptolos, etc.) work against spells not classified as "magic
missiles" such as Uranon's Thunderbolt, Storm of Cronos, Father of
the Thorn, etc?

A. No. The only spells which count as missiles are those which are
specifically noted as "magic missiles" in their descriptions.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115 / Anthony Reynolds Warhammer

*****

Q. May characters, Skaven Weapons Teams, etc. be targeted by
spells which may be cast on 'any enemy unit'?  May they be
targeted by these spells even if they are within 5" (3" for 
Skaven Weapons Teams) of a friendly unit of five or more 
similar sized models?

A. The Rulebook states "Note that characters on their own.....
are classed as units as well, so spells that target units can 
be cast on these targets." In general, only spells that are 
classified as "magic missiles" must follow the shooting rules for 
selecting targets. Please refer to the two Q&As above for 
additional guidance.
S. Rulebook pages 139, 142 

*****

Q. Can spells which affect all enemy units in sight, within a
defined range, and/or on the battlefield, etc. (e.g. Storm of
Cronos, Drain Life, Fog of Death, etc.) be cast if enemy units
are engaged in close combat within the area affected by the 
spell?

A. Yes they can be cast, but only unengaged units are affected,
as the spells do not specifically state that they can be cast
at units in combat.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Regarding spells which affect all enemy units in sight, within
a defined range, and/or on the battlefield, etc. (e.g. Storm of
Cronos, Drain Life, Fog of Death, etc.) do units with Magic
Resistance get to add their dispel dice to any attempts to dispel
these spells?

A. If a unit with Magic Resistance is a potential target for one
of these spells its Magic Resistance may be used. If multiple
units with Magic Resistance are targeted, use the highest Magic
Resistance value, NOT all of them added together.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Is the 5" template generated by the Dark Magic spell Black
Horror allowed to be placed on enemy units in close combat?

A. No.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Do spells that have the potential to hit each model in a unit
(e.g. Curse of Years) affect hidden models (e.g. Assassins, Night
Goblin Fanatics)?

A. No.  Before hidden models are revealed, there is no way that
they can be harmed.
S. Dark Elf Army Book page 11 / Direwolf FAQ Council
Interpretation

*****

Q. Does the Lore of Metal spell, Rule of Burning Iron allow the
caster to ignore normal targeting restrictions?  Can the spell
be used to pick out champions or characters inside units?

A. The spell is clearly classified as a 'Magic Missile'.  The
rules for 'Magic Missiles' state that they can only be cast at
a target if it would be a viable target according to the rules
for shooting.  Therefore the caster must have LOS to the target
unit, the target unit must be within range (24"), and the caster
can't pick out a unit consisting of one similar sized character,
Skaven weapon team, etc. within protective radius of a unit of
five or more similar sized models.  Once the caster has chosen
a valid target, the next step is to cast the spell.  If
successfully cast (and not dispelled) then the text of the
spell states:

"the spell hits a single model (chosen by the caster)"

This means that the caster may allocate the hit to a champion or
an attached character in a valid target unit.

Q. Can Uranon's Thunderbolt target characters in Buildings?

A. Yes (the thunderbolts smash through the roof, obviously!)

Q. With spells such as Flames of the Phoenix and Curse of Years,
it states that each model in the target unit is struck.  What
happens with Characters riding Monsters or Chariots?  Are both
the Character and the Monster/Chariot struck, or is only one hit
allocated per model, in which case the hit would be randomized
like shooting?

A. Both the Character and the Mount/Chariot take a hit.

*****

MAGIC RESISTANCE

Q. If a character has Magic Resistance and joins a unit, does the
whole unit benefit from that Magic Resistance?

A. Yes
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A on the

*****

Q. Do items or abilities which provide extra dispel dice when
targeted by enemy spells work the same as items specifically
noted with "Magic Resistance"?

A. These extra dispel dice (which appeared in some of the item
descriptions early in Sixth edition) should be treated just like
Magic Resistance.  We will be amending the offending items in
reprints as they come up.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. If a unit has multiple sources of Magic Resistance (e.g. MR(1)
from a character and MR(2) from a magic banner) do we add the
sources together for the MR value to apply or do we simply
apply the highest value?

A. Apply the highest value.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Can units with "Magical Resistance" dice use these dice to
dispel chain spells (e.g. Gork's Warpath, Plague) when they are
not the first unit targeted?  Does Magic Resistance count against
Comet of Cassandora and other spells that have a random range of
effect? Also, may units with "Magical Resistance" dice use these
dice to dispel "remains in play" spells in subsequent turns?

A. No to all of the above.  Note that it is not enough for the
unit with Magic Resistance to be a potential target.  The unit
has to be an actual target of the spell. Magic Resistance, like
dispel scrolls, comes into affect only at the point when the
magical energy is summoned (i.e. the spell is cast).  Once the
effects of the spells become a reality,it's too late.

LORES OF MAGIC

Q. What is the corrected description for the first three paragraphs
of the Lore of Fire spell, Wall of Fire?

A. This spell has a range of 24" and can be cast on an enemy unit 
visible to the caster which has no models (friend or foe) within 1" 
of its front rank (walls, hedges and other scenic features don’t
matter). The spell cannot be cast on units with a 360؛ line of sight.

A searing wall of flame suddenly rises in front of the unit. To 
represent this take some cotton wool or paper and place this in a 
line up to 1" thick in front of the unit.

The unit suffers 1 automatic hit for each model (including 
characters) in its front rank. Each hit is resolved with a 
Strength of 4.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 122

*****

Q. What is the corrected description for the Lore of Metal spell,
Bane of Forged Steel?

A. This spell has a range of 12" and can be cast on an enemy unit 
which is visible to the caster. If successfully cast, the enemy’s 
weapons begin to crumble and rust away. No weapon bonuses or
penalties apply to the affected unit for the remainder of the 
battle. For example, a unit wielding Great Swords will not get their
+2 Strength bonus in combat for the rest of the battle, but will 
now not have to strike last. A unit with missile weapons may not 
shoot for the duration of the entire battle. Affected units are
assumed to use their fist/claws, etc, and so cannot benefit from 
the rules for using two hand weapons or a hand weapon and shield. 
War machines and magic weapons cannot be affected by the Bane of
Forged Steel – only ordinary weaponry carried by troops.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 122

*****

Q. What is the corrected description for the first paragraph of the 
Lore of Shadows spell, Steed of Shadows?

A. This spell may be cast upon the Wizard himself or any single 
friendly independent character model within 12" of him – the spell 
can only be cast on a model with a Unit Strength of 1 (it won’t work 
on a mounted model or a model riding in a chariot, for example).

Q. If a unit has the spell Pelt of Midnight (from the Lore of Shadow) 
cast upon it, does this have any affect against a flame template from
a Dragon, Gyrocopter, etc.?

A. No.

Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can the Lore of Beasts spell, The Oxen Stands (which
immediately rallies fleeing troops) be used to rally a unit
that is at less than 25% of its starting size?

A. No. Per guidance from the Design Team questions such as this
should be answered with the phrase "if normally allowed" in mind.
As a unit that is less than 25% of its starting size is not
normally allowed to rally, the spell can not be used to rally
the unit.

*****

Q. The rules for the Comet of Casandora (Lore of Heavens) state that
it remains in play, but the standard statement “stays in play until 
Wizards wants to cancel it, or he dies” is not included. Is it so
powerful that it must actively be dispelled to stop it, and survives 
even if the caster dies?

A. Once the comet is on its way, the death of the wizard does not
automatically cancel the spell (you can jump up and down on the 
wizard all you like, it ain’t gonna stop fifty tons of star iron
slapping into the battlefield). You can however attempt to dispel 
it in subsequent turns as usual. 
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Does the Lore of Light spell, Guardian Light immediately rally
fleeing troops within 12" in the magic phase?

A. No. The spell states that fleeing troops within 12" will
automatically rally.  This means that fleeing troops will not
have to take leadership tests in the rally stage of their next
turn and will automatically rally at that time.  Note the
difference in wording between Guardian Light and the Lore of
Beasts spell, The Oxen Stands.

Q. Are the Revised Lores of Magic "Official"?

A. Warhammer Chronicles 2004 lists them as "Trial Rules", while the
Warhammer Annual 2004 (UK) includes all materials in the book as
official.  Gav Thorpe of the Warhammer Design Team has stated that
it isn't fair to expect someone just starting out to have to buy 
anything besides the basic rulebook and thus the Revised Lores of 
Magic are not "Official" (there was a mistake in regards to the 
Warhammer Annual 2004), however the Design Team always uses the 
revised Lores of Magic and the Revised Lores of Magic should be 
thought of as "Unofficial but Highly Recommended". For tournament

16. MAGIC ITEMS

+++++

Q. Does a character have to have the option of a mundane version of a
magic item (like a shield) in his army list entry in order to take a
magical version?

A. A character who may not take normal armour (ie, has no option for
normal armour in his army list entry) may not wear magic armour. A
Battle Standard Bearer who can’t have a normal shield can’t take a
magical shield. Similarly, a Battle Standard Bearer is not allowed to
take magical weapons that require two hands. 

However, note that these last two are specific restrictions for
Battle Standard Bearers – a character who does not normally have the
option for a great weapon could still take a magic weapon that 
requires two hands to use, for example. The same goes for ranged 
magic weapons – you don’t necessarily need a mundane missile weapon 
option to take one. Only Wizards can take Arcane items. Some 
characters (such as Slann Mage-Priests, or Dwarf Daemon Slayers) may 
have additional restrictions or allowances.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 116.

Q. If a character has an armor upgrade option, but not a shield upgrade
option (the DE Beastmaster in the errata for example), can he take
magical shields, and/or magical armours that are stated to include a
shield (armor of darkness) 

A. No. 
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team

*****

Q. Must a character armed with a magical close combat weapon 
always use it in close combat?

A. Yes. Page 152 states "A character who has a magic close 
combat weapon cannot use other close combat weapons".  A 
character with a functioning magic weapon must use it.
S. Gav Thorpe - Warhammer Design Team

Q. Can magic weapons or shields be combined with mundane weapons or
shields and still receive the bonus Armour save in close combat?

A. No, magic weapons and shields don’t grant the bonus Armour save, in
any combination. You must have a mundane hand weapon and mundane 
shield (and be a model on foot) to earn the bonus Armour save.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 116.

*****

Q. When the bearer of a magic item that affects models in base to 
base contact is engaged in a challenge, which models are affected 
by the magic item ?

A. In a challenge, only the model engaged in the challenge counts
as being in contact with the bearer.  The Direwolf FAQ Council has
used the main challenge rules in conjunction with the detailed 
description of the Tomb Kings magic weapon, The Destroyer of 
Eternities, to arrive at this anwer.

Q. Do the hits from all magic weapons, including bows and 
other missile weapons, count as "magical"?

A. Yes. Any attack from a magic weapon counts as magical.

*****

Q. For purposes of magic items which protect against 'missile'
fire (e.g. Storm Banner, Golden Eye of Tzeentch, Wristbands 
of Black Gold, etc.), what constitutes a 'missile'?

A. Any item which does direct damage and originates from a 
source not in base contact with the target.  This includes 
hits from missile weapons, war machines, template attacks, etc.  
Note, however that the only spells which constitute 'missiles' are 
those specifically noted as "magic missiles".  Also, just for the
record, a Banshee's scream is not considered a missile!

Q. How do you work out close combat attacks that do multiple wounds 
against units of creatures with multiple Wounds (such as Trolls,
Ogres or Fellbats)?

A. When fighting rank and file troops with more than one Wound, use 
the same procedure you would for normal troops. Roll to hit, roll to
wound, make saves. After this, roll for each wounding hit to see how 
many actual wounds are inflicted by the weapon. The maximum number 
of wounds per hit is the number of Wounds the enemy models have. 
For example, if you have a magic sword that does D3 wounds and are 
fighting Fellbats (which have 2 Wounds each), you would have to 
count results of 3 as 2 wounds inflicted. Once the total number of
wounds have been rolled, add them all up and remove whole models as 
normal. To continue the previous example, if you did 1, 2 and 2
wounds from three hits, this is 5 wounds and so you remove two 
Fellbats and one Fellbat has a single wound remaining.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 115.

*****

Q. When a model that has an item providing a ward save against the
first wound suffered is attacked by another model with killing blow,
what will happen if a normal wound and a killing blow is inflicted? 
Will the killing blow be deflected or will you roll to see which 
wound was dealt first? 

A. You roll to see which wound was inflicted first. 
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can the Gem of Blood save against a Killing Blow? If so, is the
Killing Blow rebounded back onto the attacker?

A. In cases like these, items should be treated just like a Ward
save. So, if the save is passed, then the character takes no
damage, and the wound rebounded. However, just a single wound is
rebounded, not the killing blow itself.
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. Can you use a Dispel Scroll to dispel a spell cast in a previous
turn and has remained in play?

A. No. It says in the description of the item that it needs to be 
used "as soon as a spell has been cast." If the spell was cast in 
the previous turn, this won’t be the case.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 115.

*****

Q. Can a fleeing Wizard use Dispel Scrolls?

A. No. It states that ‘fleeing Wizards are not allowed to cast or
dispel spells’. I’d say using a Dispel Scroll counts as dispelling
a spell.
S.  Wahammer Chronicles 2004 page 115

*****

Q. Can I use a Powerstone as the only source to power a spell, or can
I only use it to add to dice I am already using?

A. No, a power stone cannot be used on its own. 
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A
on the Games Workshop Warhammer Forum)

*****

Q. May a Wizard be equipped with Power Stones and another Arcane item 
at the same time? 

A. No. The general rule is that characters may only be equipped with one 
magic item from each category (Magic Weapons, Talismans, Arcane Items, 
etc.) 

While Wizards have been granted an explicit exception in the Power Stones 
description which makes it possible for several Wizards to carry Power 
Stones and for a single Wizard to carry more than one, they are not given 
an explicit exception to allow a single Wizard to carry Power Stones and 
another Arcane item. 
S. Rulebook pages 152, 153, 154

*****

Q. If a battle standard bearer in a unit refuses a challenge and goes
into the back, does the unit still benefits from the magic banner he
holds ? 

A. No, unless specifically stated otherwise (for example, Skaven) a
unit is only affected by a magic banner if it is in the front or
fighting rank. 
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 116.

*****

Q. If a unit is fleeing but has not dropped its magical standard, is
the magical effect still "on" ? A banner that improves Ld would be
useful in this case… 

A. No (with the exception of magical banners that affect rally 
attempts or automatically rally units). 
S. Anthony Reynolds - Warhammer Design Team (Online Q&A

Direwolf FAQ Council Interpretation

*****

Q. Some armies have items/runes that can destroy a spell on a 4+. Can
you use them to destoy the Casket of Souls incantation (since it's 
said to be an incantation of power level 2D6)? What about the Anvil 
of Doom?

A. These items have no effect on the Casket of Souls or the Anvil of
Doom, even if they can affect bound items.
S. Warhammer Chronicles 2004, page 116.

*****

Q. May an magic item, spell, or special ability that allows a player to 
re-roll a D6, be used to re-roll a D3? 

A. Yes.  The instructions in the Rulebook for a D3 begin: "Roll a D6 and 
halve the score."  A player may re-roll the result of a D6 prior 
to halving the result to generate the D3 result.

## ⚔️ Part 2: The Great Lakes Warhammer League (GLWL) Precedents

*Context: The GLWL was a premier 6th Edition tournament circuit. Their historic rulings on base sizes, Unit Strength, and Ravening Hordes integration remain the global standard for competitive play and are hardcoded into this engine.*

### General Line of Sight and Targeting
**Ruling:** "Intent" does not override physical line of sight. If a model cannot physically draw a clear line of sight to a target due to intervening models or terrain, it cannot declare a charge or shooting attack, regardless of whether the player knows the enemy is there.

## ⛰️ Part 3: The Norn Consensus

*Context: Established in 2003, The Karak Norn Wargaming Club provides the Norn Consensus: a compilation of rules resolutions and tournament precedents debated by the Karak Norn Longbeard circle during the original 6th Edition era (2003-2006). This section documents their structural resolutions, translating unresolved tabletop edge-cases into the strict mechanical logic required by digital list-builders. (Note: The digitization of the historical archive is an ongoing process. Additional rulings will be indexed here as they are translated for engine compatibility.)*

### 1. Stacking "Stubborn" and "Immune to Psychology" (Native Traits Bypass)
**Q:** Can a model or unit benefit from both the *Stubborn* and *Immune to Psychology* special rules at the same time if they are innate traits?
**Ruling:** Yes, provided both rules are innate to the model's profile or granted by non-magical traits. Break tests are not Psychology tests. Therefore, a model that natively possesses both rules will take its Break tests on its unmodified Leadership while simultaneously ignoring tests for Fear, Terror, and Panic.
**Important Exception:** This native stacking does not contradict the official ruling regarding the Banner of Sigismund. The core reasoning provided in that FAQ is that "there is no magic vs. mundane trump anymore." Because innate traits are inherent, non-magical abilities, they completely bypass the Magic vs. Mundane conflict.
